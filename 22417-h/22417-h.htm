<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> customs of social life need frequent restating
and adaptation to new needs. They
are customs because they are the best rules of
conduct that have been garnered from the experiences
of succeeding generations under common
conditions.</p>

<p>To know them, to catch their spirit, and to
follow them in an intelligent way, without
slavish punctiliousness but with careful observance,
make one skillful in the art of social
intercourse, and at home in any society.</p>

<p>Etiquette will not take the place of character,
nor of an accurate knowledge of human nature
and the arts of practical life. Given these,
however, it will unlock to any man or woman
doors of success and profit and real happiness
which, without it, would have remained forever
closed.</p>

<h2>THE ETIQUETTE OF<br />
TO-DAY</h2>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE REWARDS OF ETIQUETTE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Society</span> is a game which all men play.
"Etiquette" is the name given the rules of the
game. If you play it well, you win. If you
play it ill, you lose. The prize is a certain sort
of happiness without which no human being is
ever quite satisfied.</p>

<p>Because the demand for social happiness is
thus fundamental in human nature, the game
has to be played quite seriously. If played
seriously, it is perforce successful, even when
the outward signs of triumph are lacking.
Played seriously, it becomes a worthy part of
the great enterprise of noble living, the science
of which is called "Ethics." Therefore the best
etiquette is that which is based upon the fundamental
principles of ethics.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><a href="images/2.png">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>The etiquette, as well as the ethics, of to-day
may well be summed up in the one maxim
known as the "Golden Rule": "Do unto
others as you would that others should do unto
you." Or in the philosophic statement of it,
given by Kant: "Act so that the maxim of thy
conduct shall be fit to be universal law."</p>

<p>A certain social sense is, therefore, the
foundation upon which all concerted action
rests; and this, permeating the character and
winning conformity in the life, produces a
social order which is at once the criterion of
civilization and the source of its power.</p>

<p>Every social code presupposes the trained
personality, that is, the individual who is intelligent
enough and controlled enough to conform
to the rules prescribed for the good of all.
It is only in the common good that true individual
good can be found. Therefore is it so
essential that every man regard his brother's
welfare as anxiously as his own, and permit
himself to be curbed in his extravagances, limited
in the indulgence of even legitimate desires,
in order that he may not defraud another,
or menace the general well-being.</p>

<p>Not only in social life, but in business, politics,
and international relations, this principle
of the common good as the ultimate goal, the
supreme authority for conduct, holds good. To
it society approaches, now by direct progress and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><a href="images/3.png">[3]</a></span>
now by seeming reaction, but ever with a higher
evaluation of justice. This is shown in the fulfillment
of both small and large obligations.</p>

<p>Following the rules of courtesy, men give to
each other that deference which each believes is
his own due, and each receives in return twofold
the deference that he sincerely gives. Men
show, at home and abroad, the courtesy to
women in general that they would wish shown
to those of their family, and thereby the standard
of respect for woman is so lifted that even
the city street at night is a safe place for a
woman to pass unaccosted, if it is necessary for
her to go unattended.</p>

<p>Rigidly do we hold ourselves to the established
rules of good breeding, endeavoring to
make of ourselves all that Nature will permit;
and we are surprised to find that Nature's own
gentlemen and gentlewomen gather about us,
and rare souls look to us for companionship, as
finding in us kindred spirits.</p>

<p>No field so surely bears a like harvest as the
one sown with the seeds of good-will and consideration
for others.</p>

<p>Etiquette tells us how to accomplish what we
desire,&mdash;to make clear the path to the goal
of high companionship with many worthy
minds,&mdash;and enables us to get out of social intercourse
the honey that is hidden there.
Without it, as social beings, we should be as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><a href="images/4.png">[4]</a></span>
workmen without tools, architects without material,
musicians without instruments.</p>

<p>After all, however, etiquette is only a tool,
and should never be mistaken for the finished
work itself. How you carry yourself at a reception
is not a matter of so great moment, as is
the fact that you went, and there exchanged
certain worth-while thoughts with certain
people. It is the people, the thoughts they gave
you and you gave them, and the practical influence
on your life of those people and those
thoughts, which are of moment.</p>

<p>Just as, from a musicale, you must carry the
music away in your soul, either in definite
memories or in a refreshed and more joyous
frame of mind, or it is of no avail that you
attended, so from social intercourse it is absolutely
necessary that you carry away the inspiration
of meeting others and the thoughts
that they have given you, and garner from
those help and guidance in your life, or the
most elaborate of toilets, the most perfect of
manners, and the most ceremonious of customs
are of little worth.</p>

<p>The tool, however, becomes invaluable when
the master desires to create. Therefore, if we
wish to gain from social life the enjoyment
and happiness and help which it should
yield, we should become familiar with the practice
of the best forms of etiquette, so that we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><a href="images/5.png">[5]</a></span>
shall have skill and aptitude in their application.</p>

<p>The rewards of etiquette are, therefore, both
spiritual and material. That fine poise of soul
which restrains all selfish and unlovely tendencies,
that clear insight which sees the individual
as but a single unit in the composite
of the human race, that high aspiration which
culls only the best from the mingled elements
of life,&mdash;all these come from a true and sincere
adherence to the spirit of courteous observances,
and each of these is its own reward.</p>

<p>On the other hand, human hearts open only
to gentle influences, and all that it is in the
power of human beings to bestow upon one another
comes most readily and most lavishly to
those who outrage no social instinct. To be
highly and sincerely honored socially means to
be well loved, and that must mean to be lovable.
Wealth and family position are matters of
chance as far as the individual is concerned,
but good breeding is a matter of personal desire
and effort. It makes for power and influence,
and often literally commands the wealth and
position which the accident of birth has refused.
It is the necessary colleague of intellectual
ability in winning the farthest heights of success,
and makes the plains of mediocre attainment
habitable and pleasant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><a href="images/6.png">[6]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>PERSONALITY</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> social world is a world of personalities.
Each individual has a value and importance
according to the sum total of his characteristics,
physical, mental, and moral. Other and more
external facts enter into his social position, but
in the circle of his friends and acquaintances, in
whatever grade of society he may move, his
place is determined by his personality. Personality
alone is the final test of a man's worth
to society.</p>

<p>A man's worth to the business world as a
doer, maker, or as any other executive, his
worth to the state as an incorruptible official,
his worth to his family as a devoted husband
and father, his worth to literature or art as a
thinker or maker,&mdash;these values are imprinted
upon his personality, howbeit with almost imperceptible
lines.</p>

<p>If a man would present a pleasing personality
as his claim for recognition in society, he
must not neglect his mental attitude, his appearance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><a href="images/7.png">[7]</a></span>
his manners, or his speech. They
are all true expressions of his real self, and
they, together with his deeds, are all that his
fellow men have by which to appraise his real
worth.</p>

<p>Character is the foundation of all true courtesy,
for manners are but minor morals, as
many a writer has shown. It is not the part
of a book on etiquette to tell how to keep out
of prison, or to explain that one should be
honorable and should do no murder. No book
or person, however, can inculcate etiquette without
showing that the roots of all true courtesy
lie deep in the spirit of unselfish consideration
for others. To master this spirit until it becomes
one's own is the best fitting one can have
for social achievement. Such consideration is
the touchstone by which all social customs are
tried, to see whether they be worthy of perpetuation
or not. It is the sure test of correct
conduct under all circumstances, and can be so
utilized in case of doubt.</p>

<p>A veneer of virtue long passes as currency in
no society. It is necessary to have character
in order to be respected. As etiquette is
founded upon certain simple virtues, it is necessary,
at least, to affect the semblance of them.
To be long effective they must be sincere, as a
little experience shows.</p>

<p>Among the minor moral virtues which in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><a href="images/8.png">[8]</a></span>
social life are of major importance are those
of self-control, sincerity, and unselfishness.</p>

<p>There is no place for anger in social life. To
give expression among a group of people to any
strong feeling, no matter how justified it may
be, is not courteous, because you may be inadvertently
treading upon the beliefs or prejudices
of some of your hearers. There are times when
debate and the taking of sides on questions of
common interest are in order, but that is not
usually in the mixed society of men and
women, who are supposedly dropping, for a
time, the burdens of life for the sake of enjoyment
and recreation.</p>

<p>Self-control is necessary not only in the constant
curbing of anger and the more violent
emotions, but in pushing into the background
one's personal desires in order that one may do
one's social duty. A bridesmaid may have
assumed the obligations of that honor, and then
found that, for personal reasons, they were distasteful
to her. She should not, however, permit
herself to fail in one iota of her duty. The
always-remembered disappointment of the bride,
or bridegroom, if either bridesmaid or best
man should fail, at a time when life should be
as full of happiness as it possibly could, should
more than offset the pain of even difficult control
on the part of the chosen friend, in order
to carry out his or her obligations satisfactorily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><a href="images/9.png">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>In thousands of minor circumstances the
need of absolute self-command for the sake of
social virtues is evident. The man and woman
who can so control themselves, and think only
of others, win warm places in the hearts of
their friends.</p>

<p>It is a dreary thing to be always sustaining
a sham of any sort. Sincerity has its pleasure
as well as its virtue. One should seek to be
sincere, as perhaps no social virtue is of greater
importance than this. The possibilities of development
of character and of the betterment
of social customs depend upon the exercise of
this virtue. For that reason it is well to follow
carefully the acknowledged rules of etiquette,
in the hope and expectation of growing into the
attitude of mind which will make them a natural
expression of one's self.</p>

<p>"The little observances of social life," says
Dr. T. L. Nichols in his book on "Social Life,"
"are more important than many people think
them. The outward signs or expressions of any
sentiment not only manifest it to others, but
help to keep it active in ourselves. This is the
use of all ceremony and ritualism in religion
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the same principle governs all social
ceremonies and observances."</p>

<p>Without unselfishness and a fine consideration
for others, the art of etiquette would be
impossible. True etiquette learns no maxims<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><a href="images/10.png">[10]</a></span>
to practise mechanically. Rather, it learns all
the maxims upon which it may have to draw,
and practises them only as the considerate heart
sees an opportunity and desires to embrace it.</p>

<p>Personal appearance is next to character in
importance. The most important factors in
this, with the average person, are not those
that Nature alone is responsible for, but those
that the individual himself is alone responsible
for. Beauty is a pleasant thing, and not to be
despised, although beauty alone is of little
worth. The social conquests of history have
not been confined to the possessors of beauty,
and there have been many notable cases where
decided plainness and even ugliness was the lot
of one who nevertheless was a person of great
charm.</p>

<p>One's figure and bearing count perhaps for
most, as they give the first and distant impression,
and are, as it were, the outlines of the
picture.</p>

<p>Self-consciousness, for any reason and to
even the slightest degree, is a great barrier to
social intercourse and to mental freedom. It
shows as often in a person's carriage as in his
words or features. It should be broken down
at all costs, and this can be done only by the
person himself. It may be done, usually with
comparative ease, by becoming and staying interested
in something. Then awkwardness, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><a href="images/11.png">[11]</a></span>
a defiant attitude of spirit and body, will vanish.
Haughtiness is usually the outward sign
of a great inner self-consciousness. All of these
traits, as well as their opposites, stamp themselves
upon the bearing of the body, and reveal
there the clearest manifestations of character.</p>

<p>Dress is almost as essential. By this is not
meant a rigid adherence to fashion,&mdash;the stamp
of a weak mind,&mdash;or even good taste, but an
eye to the appropriate and fitting. First of all,
dress should be subordinated to character, that
is, it should be no more costly than the wearer
can afford, and no more striking than modesty
and good taste allow.</p>

<p>Good taste in dress means plain and simple
styles, but material as elegant, serviceable, and
pleasing as one's purse permits. It means also
a few things well chosen and kept in good order,
rather than many things more or less untidy;
that one's wardrobe will be harmonious,&mdash;not
a cheap, shabby garment to-day, and an expensive,
showy one to-morrow. It means also
that the wardrobe throughout, not only the external
garments, is equally well chosen and well
cared for.</p>

<p>One should not mix one's wardrobe. A coat
of one suit and the skirt of another should not
be worn together. A carriage parasol should
not be used on a sunny promenade, nor an umbrella
in a carriage, or open automobile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><a href="images/12.png">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>It is necessary to wear a dress appropriate
to the occasion in order to be well dressed. No
matter how excellent one's costume may be, if
it does not suit the time and place it is absurd
and incongruous. Some of the major rules for
appropriate dress are as follows:</p>

<p>Full evening dress demands one's most elaborate
gown, made of silk, satin, velvet, lace,
or cr&ecirc;pe-de-chine, as costly as one's purse permits,
with d&eacute;collet&eacute; effects, gained by either
actual cut or the use of lace and chiffon. One
should wear delicate shoes, white or light-colored
gloves, and appropriate jewels, of which it
is not good taste to have too lavish a display.</p>

<p>As hostess at an afternoon reception or luncheon
one may wear an elaborate gown of the richest
materials, with either long sleeves and high
neck, or elbow sleeves and slightly low neck.
As guest one may wear a walking suit, with
pretty blouse, white gloves, and decorative hat.</p>

<p>The usual dress for a formal breakfast is
much the same as for a luncheon,&mdash;a pretty
afternoon street costume, with a dainty blouse,
gloves, and "picture" hat, which is not removed.
In summer, a gown of light material,
such as organdie, muslin, or other soft goods,
dainty and somewhat elaborate, is in good taste.
Hat and gloves are invariably worn with this
gown if the affair is ceremonious.</p>

<p>For church wear, a quiet, rather simple street<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><a href="images/13.png">[13]</a></span>
dress, which does not proclaim that either
money or time has been spent upon it to any
notable extent, is by far the most appropriate.
The suit should be becoming but inconspicuous.</p>

<p>Ball costume is conventionally gay and elaborate,
the lightest of materials being used, especially
by those who intend to take part in the
dancing, and a dainty effect being sought. Any
costly, rich-looking materials are used, and a
wide range of fashion is permitted. The gown
is cut short-sleeved and d&eacute;collet&eacute;, and the dancing
shoes are of satin or very fine kid. Jewels
are worn but sparingly by young women in their
first season in society. The costume of a d&eacute;butante
at her first ball is usually white.</p>

<p>At an informal dinner, any pretty gown may
be worn, with special attention to the coiffure.</p>

<p>Black should never be worn at a wedding.
If one does not care to lay it aside for the time
being, one should not attend.</p>

<p>For men, the proper costume for an early
morning breakfast is the black cutaway coat with
gray trousers, and other details as for a formal
breakfast. In summer a gray morning suit with
fancy waistcoat, or white flannels or linen, with
appropriate hat, shoes, and tie, is permissible.</p>

<p>At a formal breakfast men wear frock coats,
fancy waistcoats, gray trousers, patent-leather
shoes, large ties, high hats, and gray gloves.</p>

<p>Afternoon dress for formal functions between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><a href="images/14.png">[14]</a></span>
noon and evening consists of a double-breasted
black frock coat, or a black cutaway coat, with
either light or dark waistcoat, gray trousers,
patent-leather shoes, light four-in-hand tie, and
light gloves.</p>

<p>Evening dress is the correct attire for all
occasions after six o'clock. It consists of a
black suit,&mdash;coat cut "swallow-tail," and
waistcoat cut low and in the shape of a "U,"&mdash;with
white lawn tie, patent-leather pumps, black
silk stockings, white gloves, and no jewelry but
shirt studs, cuff links, and an inconspicuous
watch fob. A black overcoat of some stylish
cut and a silk hat or crush or opera hat is also
worn.</p>

<p>Full evening dress is a man's costume for a
formal dinner. The Tuxedo or short dinner
coat with a black tie is intended only for dinners
where women are not present. Although
its use on other occasions is common, it is not
correct, and ill accords with the elaborate gown
which is usually worn at the formal dinner.</p>

<p>One should always have the appearance of
being "well-groomed." It is a minor matter to
add to habits of personal cleanliness, which
every man and woman of refinement adheres to
with scrupulous conscientiousness, that attention
to the little details and finishing touches of
dressing, which give the impression conveyed in
that graphic expression "well-groomed." The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><a href="images/15.png">[15]</a></span>
niceties of life are always matters of small care
but great moment.</p>

<p>The aim to be beautiful is a legitimate one,
and worthy of the attention of every lover of
beauty. To make the most of one's self, both
for one's own sake and that of those about one,
is a duty. Much can be done if good taste is
consulted, and one's salient good points studied
and emphasized. One can at least dress characteristically,
and so bring out the ideals to
which one gives adherence.</p>

<p>For instance, the business woman, in business
hours, dresses with that same effort after
efficiency and economy of time and strength
that she has to put into her business to make
it successful. She is, therefore, besides being
scrupulously neat, perfectly plainly and yet
durably and comfortably dressed. The sudden
storm does not catch her unprepared, for she
cannot afford to lose even an hour's work next
day because she "caught cold." She permits
no fussing with her garments, therefore they
have to be in perfect working order, as fussing
takes time, and time is money. Her hair is
done neatly, and as becomingly as possible, but
securely for the day.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the business woman be
a milliner, whose own artistic personality must
be her best advertisement, she takes pains to
dress artistically even though she wear less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><a href="images/16.png">[16]</a></span>
serviceable and more elaborate costumes. She
should, however, give the same impression of
neatness and businesslike serviceableness, with
the additional artistic impression which is going
to show her customer that she knows how to
bring out the telling points in her own personality,
and create a charming effect.</p>

<p>The housewife needs, in her choice of morning
garments, the same effectiveness as the business
woman, for she must also work with real
efficiency; but, in addition, she needs to give
the impression of homelike abandon, as well as
beauty and grace, which shall appear restful.</p>

<p>The art of correct speech and intelligent conversation
is one which every one who wishes to
hold an envied place in society should possess.
There is no more attractive accomplishment.
Others have only a limited use and give only
an occasional pleasure, while good conversation
is appropriate to almost any occasion, and
amuses and entertains when all other interests
have palled.</p>

<p>If one does not undertake to cultivate the art
of conversation, one should at least be correct
in speech. One should not permit slovenly
expressions, or slang, or the thousand and one
faults of mispronunciation and ungrammatical
construction into which people fall, to be characteristic
of one's speaking. For if one has time
to go into society, one should have time and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><a href="images/17.png">[17]</a></span>
money enough to make one's self presentable
mentally as well as physically, and nothing so
clearly shows lack of intelligence and appreciation
of the matters of the intellect, as carelessness
and neglect of the words one uses and the
thoughts one utters. No physical defect is more
glaring than the mental defect revealed in every
sentence of such a person.</p>

<p>Mannerisms of speech or act are glaring flaws
in the personality which would delight to charm,
and successfully preclude the possibility of popularity
among refined people. Many a man
and woman of character have been barred from
the pleasurable enjoyment of society, even by
people of less character though of more surface
refinement than themselves, because they lacked
the intelligence and the good sense to abolish
certain mannerisms of act or expression, which,
though they may have had normal and logical
causes, were not such as society could enjoy or
approve, and would not tend to anything but
harm if characteristic of many people.</p>

<p>Certain rather glaring faults are quite conspicuous
among all classes of women, for reasons
which are hard to determine, but which must be
general as the faults are so prevalent. Women,
as a rule, do not respect an appointment and
keep it punctually, interrupt conversation repeatedly
and ruthlessly, keep visitors waiting
by needless delays, and do not seem to notice or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><a href="images/18.png">[18]</a></span>
regret the sacrifice that some courtesy to them
may have caused another.</p>

<p>The arraignment of women for these faults
is indeed serious, for social misdemeanors could
not easily be much worse. It means that the
deep heart-feeling of courtesy is quite lacking
from certain classes of women,&mdash;classes not to
be marked off distinctly from any grade of
wealth or learning. If the ladies of a fashionable
and progressive intellectual club will not,
after two or three years of repeated requests,
make it a habit, one and all, to remove their
hats during a dinner and the subsequent
speeches in a crowded and level-floored club
dining-room, it is useless to look for any finer
courtesy among the "cultured" than among the
work-worn "laboring" classes.</p>

<p>As a rule the women least at fault in these
matters are the business women, a fact which
would seem to prove that lack of business and
professional training was in part responsible
for the general apathy and indifference toward
these matters of ordinary courtesy.</p>

<p>Courtesy, like honesty, is the best policy in
all our dealings with our fellow men. Therefore,
we cannot afford to neglect to exercise it.</p>

<p>Politeness and interest in others alike lead
one to make those inquiries concerning friends
and their families which show real concern in
their welfare, and which are exceedingly gratifying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><a href="images/19.png">[19]</a></span>
to all. Often this kindly trait alone
gives one a reputation for charm, although it
has its disadvantages, to be sure, in its demands
upon one's sympathy and patience.</p>

<p>We each know that we are worth while. We
should, therefore, treat others on that assumption,
and thereby make them rise to their potential
worth. The good that a person, who thus
calls out the good within people, may do is
limited only by his acquaintance.</p>

<p>Personality is, after all, one's greatest asset
in life. No thought or effort should be spared
in making it pleasing and inspiring,&mdash;a fit
expression of one's character and ideals, and a
worthy gift to the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><a href="images/20.png">[20]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>FAMILY ETIQUETTE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> permanence of a courteous manner is
the test of its sincerity. If one is polite invariably
everywhere but at home, one's politeness
is as superficial as a disguise, and as easily
penetrated by the discerning.</p>

<p>Unselfish consideration for others meets its
sternest discipline in the home and in family
relations, and becomes, under that discipline, a
reliable guide, instinctively consulted in every
emergency.</p>

<p>Without manners at home, it is impossible
to preserve the real nobility and unselfishness
of character which make a man or a woman
socially desirable.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Obligations of the Married</i></div>

<p>The marriage relation, while based upon certain
fundamental principles, and not to be preserved
without adherence to them, has some
little etiquette of its own which adds to its
happiness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><a href="images/21.png">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The solemnization of marriage is a sacred
ceremony and should be observed in a reverent
spirit. To partake of its home intimacies for
the first time as of a sacrament, and to perpetuate
that same spirit on the anniversaries of the
day, will do much toward making it a holy and
a happy union.</p>

<p>Every marriage should be at least a perfect
friendship; so a married couple should observe
with each other the same little courtesies that
they would observe if still only friends, being
as deferential in greeting one another in public,
as careful of each other's feelings, and as observant
of each other's preferences.</p>

<p>A woman should remember to accept from
her husband, as her due and without surprise
or awkwardness, the little attentions which she
expects and receives in society. A man, also,
should expect, and not be disappointed in receiving,
the graceful little appreciations and
courtesies which the woman of charm extends
to the man of achievement in her social circle.
The difference between the appreciations of society
and those of the family is mainly that, in
society, only the men of mark receive them,
while, in the home, every man should receive
his due; for there his efforts are known, even
though they are not signal enough for society
to recognize.</p>

<p>As equality is the only basis upon which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><a href="images/22.png">[22]</a></span>
authority of the home can happily rest, so a
complete union of interests is the only basis for
the successful financing of a home.</p>

<p>While all the virtues of good management
of her household, economy in the expenditure
of money, taste in dressing herself and her children,
and promptness and charm in fulfilling
her social duties are expected of a wife, and
should be fulfilled to the best of her ability,
there are some minor things which make for
happiness which should not be neglected.</p>

<p>The wife who shines socially should remember
that her family needs the charm of her
presence more than society does, and it should
be a daily household quality rather than for
use only on state occasions.</p>

<p>The wife should confide in her husband on
every matter of importance. She should not
trouble him with trivial things, but, if a matter
is of concern to her, she should not fail to let
him know about it, and get his advice upon it.
The cement of love is mutual confidence.</p>

<p>If a wife takes pains to understand her husband,
to be his companion, and to do her full
duty by him, by her children, and by her home,
she cannot fail, under the ordinary circumstances
of the American home, of winning happiness
and making her husband happy. It is
in the lack of desire to understand and love
that the real menace to the happiness of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><a href="images/23.png">[23]</a></span>
home lies. The deep-hearted and thoughtful
people approach nearest the ideal of love.</p>

<p>It is taken for granted that the husband will
perform the major duties of his relation, such
as being a good citizen, a good business man,
and hence a good provider for his family, and
that he will in all things seek the mutual happiness
of his family and himself.</p>

<p>He must be considerate to his wife if he
would keep her love and respect. He should
confide his business to her as far as she, in her
inexperience, is able to grasp it, and he should
teach her the things about it which it is important
for her to know. Through his conversation
alone she can get the rudiments of a
good business training, and she will at least be
able to comprehend the changes he may make
or the difficulties in which he may find himself,
and, seeing their cause, thus be able to sympathize,
and not to blame, if reverses come. He
should so train her in business ways and
methods that, in case of his death or disability,
she could attend to the business of his estate,
even though she could not, or need not, earn
money for the family.</p>

<p>The work of adjusting the labors of each to
those of the other, so that there shall be time
for recreation and social life together, should
be a matter of mutual effort, and should not be
dropped until solved to mutual satisfaction. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><a href="images/24.png">[24]</a></span>
the members of the family cannot move in the
same social circle, and together, a serious
breach of family happiness is threatened.</p>

<p>There is no marriage license which gives the
right to constant harping upon one another's
faults. In this, as in all other respects, the rule
of friendship should prevail.</p>

<p>A husband should not open his wife's letters,
nor should a wife her husband's.</p>

<p>All invitations are sent to a husband and wife
jointly, except those for such occasions as a
stag dinner, or a luncheon or "shower" to which
ladies only are invited. If for any reason
either the husband or the wife cannot attend a
function, the other also must decline. The exceptions
to this rule are those cases where a
man or a woman of particular talent moves in a
circle the interests of which are not especially
enjoyable to the other one of the couple, or
where the health of the one precludes the
possibility of attendance upon affairs of which
the other should not be deprived. Too long or
too frequent use of the excuses which cover
these exceptions, reflects seriously upon the
marital happiness of the pair.</p>

<p>Although present together at a function, husband
and wife are not paired off together in
their entertainment. He takes some other
woman out to dinner, and she is escorted by
some other man. Even at dances and balls it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><a href="images/25.png">[25]</a></span>
is not good form for them to dance together
too frequently, except at public dances where
they are two of a private party of four or six, in
which case rotation of partners would bring
them together more frequently than if a larger
number of their personal friends were present.</p>

<p>In America a wife never shares her husband's
titles.</p>

<p>Consultation and advice together on everything
which concerns either is one of the privileges
as well as the duties of marriage.</p>

<p>To reproach for errors which were made with
good motives and the best of judgment available
at the time is always unjust.</p>

<p>Always to greet and to part from each other
with affection is the source of much happiness.</p>

<p>Neither parent should be overambitious.
Their personalities make the home, and if they
are overworked and crowded with care, the
home is not happy.</p>

<p>The mother should always remember that
home comes first, and should not absent herself
from it save at those times and for that length
of time when she is really not needed there.</p>

<p>Neither husband nor wife should confide
family matters to any one but each other, nor
discuss each other with any other person.</p>

<p>Companionship means the willingness to let
one's own mood be dominated by another.
Therefore, if they would be companionable, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><a href="images/26.png">[26]</a></span>
husband and wife should meet each other's
moods halfway. For what is lost personally
now and then, far more of greater mutual value
is obtained; and it is largely by a habit of companionableness
that the happiness of the home
can be made so satisfying that there can arise no
question of its permanence.</p>

<p>To keep one's self up to one's best standard
of speech and conduct is necessary, for only
thus can the family standard be kept high.</p>

<p>An arbitrary disposition in the home ruins
the comfort of all. Companionship and mutual
authority and helpfulness are the only foundations
for a happy home.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>General Rules of Conduct</i></div>

<p>Seek the companionship of the refined and
the gentle-mannered if you would be the same.
Move in that society in whose ways you are
versed and whose rules you practice, if you
would be appreciated or met with like courtesy.</p>

<p>Never fail to say kind words to those in distress
whom you meet. The kindness, however,
must be genuine, and come from the heart,
never in stereotyped and hollow phrases.</p>

<p>The courtesy which offers attentions should
be met with graciousness in receiving them.
Surprise is a sign that one rates one's self lower
than did the person who showed the courtesy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><a href="images/27.png">[27]</a></span>
Attentions should be warmly accepted, and the
gratitude expressed should be of the sort which
does not forget.</p>

<p>A woman, when in the presence of the men
of the family, should expect that doors will be
opened for her, that she will pass through them
first, that packages will be carried, and errands
run. She should not, however, let these little
attentions be paid her by her father or an elderly
relative.</p>

<p>Enter a room filled with people in a dignified
manner and with a slight bow to the general
company. "We all do stamp our value on ourselves"
is true enough, and our private stamp
is never more conspicuous than when we confront
a roomful of people. If we show modesty
but intense self-respect in our bearing, there is
no one who will not raise his personal estimate
of us no matter what it was.</p>

<p>The head should be well up, the body squarely
erect, the chest out. Self-consciousness at such
a time is a mistake, if natural, and shows the
actual littleness which one is trying by an upright
bearing to conceal. One should train one's
self until the meeting of people, no matter who
they may be, whether singly or in large numbers,
is a matter of no particular concern as to
deportment.</p>

<p>Never enter a room noisily, nor fail to close
a door after you, without slamming.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><a href="images/28.png">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Never take another's seat unless you give it
up upon his return.</p>

<p>Dignified postures in sitting are marks of
respect to yourself and the company you are
with. A gentleman does not sit astride a chair,
nor with legs spread out, nor a lady with her
legs crossed. Never put out your foot, in the
street car or elsewhere, or place it where it may
trouble others in passing by.</p>

<p>When several people enter a room in a private
house where you are sitting, always rise, especially
if they are older than you. When an
elderly person enters the room alone, it is always
a graceful show of deference for all
younger than he to rise and remain standing
until he is seated.</p>

<p>The greetings of night and morning are due
to all members of one's household, and should
not be omitted. The one who enters a room
where others are assembled gives the salutation
first.</p>

<p>"Good morning" is the appropriate greeting
till noon. "Good afternoon" and "Good
evening" are the greetings for the later hours
of the day. "Good-by" is, however, the common
and most acceptable form of farewell.
After an evening's entertainment, it is permissible
also to say "Good night" instead.
"Good day," "Good afternoon," and "Good
evening," used in farewell, are provincial.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><a href="images/29.png">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beg pardon," spoken with an inquiring
inflection, is much better than simply "What?"
when you do not hear what is said. The abruptness
of the latter savors of rudeness.</p>

<p>Whispering is not permissible in company,
and it is not necessary in private. Therefore,
whisper not at all, especially not in a sick-room
or in church, where the whisper is far more
penetrating than a low, distinct tone.</p>

<p>The calling up or down stairs is inconsiderate,
for you attract the attention of two floors of
people, as well as publish your message. To
carry on a conversation over the banisters is also
equally bad. Even a word of inquiry should
usually be spoken at short distance in a hall
which leads to several rooms, and where many
people may hear or be disturbed by the noise.
Such calling should never be permitted to servants
or children, for once begun its convenience
will demand its continuance.</p>

<p>Interrupting another's conversation is a serious
breach of courtesy.</p>

<p>Finding fault is a very disturbing feature of
home life, no matter how glaring the faults
which may be criticised. Faults have to be
remedied, but every effort should be made to
do it skillfully, and not make the remedy worse
than the disease.</p>

<p>Do not open your letters in company, except
in case of emergency, and in the latter, ask the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><a href="images/30.png">[30]</a></span>
permission of the company to do so. Never,
under any circumstances, open a private letter
addressed to another. If the one to whom it is
addressed is near enough to give you permission
to open it, he can usually open it himself; if
he is not by to give permission, the letter should
go to his legal representative, who then acts
according to the law.</p>

<p>Politeness as well as pity impel one to be
especially polite to the caller or visitor who is
uncongenial, or stupid, or unattractive. By
even an excess of hospitality one should try to
make up for the inevitable slight which society
always puts upon such a one.</p>

<p>Impartial courtesy is the right of all guests.
The close friend and the distant and far less
welcome relative are entitled to equal courtesy.</p>

<p>The holding of a grudge, and the failing to
forgive a slight for which apology has been
made, are the height of discourtesy. It is invariably
true that the same spirit with which
you mete out social slights will be shown you
in return. Resent each one, whether intentional
or a mere oversight, and you will surely crush
the spontaneity out of all attentions shown you,
and be met only with distrust.</p>

<p>When applied to for a favor, if you intend to
grant it, grant it graciously and readily; if you
intend to refuse, refuse with equal civility
even though firmly. None but the unmannerly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><a href="images/31.png">[31]</a></span>
will urge a request when the slightest token of
refusal has been given.</p>

<p>A gentleman may offer personal service to a
lady, if there is need, tying her shoe, or hooking
or buttoning her dress, or doing any other little
act which she cannot herself do.</p>

<p>In a company of people, it is the height of
rudeness to call attention to the form or features
or dress of any one present.</p>

<p>In using a handkerchief, always do so unobtrusively.
At the dining table it should be
used very sparingly. Better retire than be obnoxious
to even the most fastidious.</p>

<p>Never look over the shoulder of any one who
is reading or writing, whether in the home, of
in a car, or at a concert, or anywhere else.</p>

<p>Do not touch any one in order to arrest his
attention, but address him.</p>

<p>To lend a borrowed article is an appropriation
of it which is next to stealing, unless one has
permission of the owner to do so.</p>

<p>Self-control in excitement of any sort is a
most valuable trait. It always makes for comfort
of one's self and of others, and often for
safety.</p>

<p>Do not pass between two persons who are
talking together, if avoidable. If it is not, then
apologize.</p>

<p>Never refuse to receive an apology. Courtesy
requires, no matter how unforgivable the of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><a href="images/32.png">[32]</a></span>fense,
that an apology should be accepted.
Friendship may not be restored, but friendly
courtesy should always thereafter be maintained.</p>

<p>Never neglect to perform a commission which
a friend intrusted to you. Forgetfulness denotes
lack of regard for the friend.</p>

<p>Never fail to be punctual at the time appointed,
in keeping every engagement.</p>

<p>To make yourself the hero of your own story,
or to speak much of your own performances,
denotes deep-seated self-conceit, and may be very
distasteful to others, who also have achieved.</p>

<p>One's social obligations should never be neglected
unless one is determined to drop out from
one's place entirely. To acknowledge one invitation
and not another is surely to be discredited
with all.</p>

<p>Never question a child or a servant upon
family matters.</p>

<p>Fulfill your promises,&mdash;or do not promise.</p>

<p>Deaf persons should be treated with special
consideration. Act as though they could hear
what is being said, yet without laying the burden
of reply upon them, and without permitting
it to be conspicuous in any way that they
may have lost the drift of the talk. It is well to
talk both louder and more expressively when
they are present, but always more distinctly,
and somewhat more slowly. Never shout at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><a href="images/33.png">[33]</a></span>
them, or attract their attention by touching
them suddenly. This latter is not polite to any
one, but the stronger impulse to do it in case of
the deaf must be withstood. It is always better
to come within the range of their vision before
speaking to them.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Table Etiquette</i></div>

<p>A man should not seat himself at the dinner
table until his wife or his hostess is seated.
This rule holds good in the home, for if it is
not practised there, it will not be observed gracefully
in society.</p>

<p>Seat yourself not too close to nor too far from
the table.</p>

<p>Erect position at table is the first requisite.
One should so place one's seat that correct position
is possible, and then should keep it.</p>

<p>Elbows should never be placed upon the table.</p>

<p>The hands should be kept quietly in the lap
while not busy with the food. One should sit
quietly at the table, without handling the cutlery
or making useless motions, while waiting to be
served. If there is some form of grace said, or
some simple ceremony preliminary to the meal,
one should pay respectful attention silently.</p>

<p>Do not seem impatient to be served. The
meal is a social occasion and the food is an adjunct
to friendly intercourse. The success of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><a href="images/34.png">[34]</a></span>
the meal depends equally perhaps upon the food
and the conversation. Because of the interruptions
of service, conversation cannot be long
continued, or deeply thoughtful. It must be
on subjects of no great moment nor grave interest,
or on such subjects lightly touched; but it
should be on bright, cheerful topics, and as
witty as the talent of the company affords.</p>

<p>Eating should be slow, and mastication of the
food thorough, for reasons of health as well as
for the sake of appearance. No meal can be
eaten properly and adequately in less than
thirty minutes, but more than an hour for a
meal is sheer waste of both time and food, unless
the company is large, the times of waiting
between courses long, and the portions served
very small.</p>

<p>Eat silently. The noise of food being masticated
is very distressing, and except in cases
of crusts and crisp vegetables, perfectly unnecessary.</p>

<p>The napkin is unfolded and spread over the
lap. One is supposed to be skillful enough in
raising food to the lips not to need the napkin
in front of the dress or coat to prevent injury.</p>

<p>In case you do not care for a course, you
should not refuse it. Receive it, and take
what part of it you desire, trying to take some;
or, if you wish, leave it untouched, but do not
have the appearance of being neglected or ill-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><a href="images/35.png">[35]</a></span>provided
for, even if you do not eat of it. A
little more attention to conversation on your
part may make unnoticeable to those about you
the fact that you do not eat of a certain course.</p>

<p>If your preference is consulted as to food,
whether the matter be trivial to you or not,
express some preference so that the one who is
serving, and who has asked to be guided, may
be so far assisted.</p>

<p>Never place food or waste matter upon the
tablecloth. An exception to this may be made
in regard to hard breads and celery, when individual
dishes for these are not furnished. Always
use the side of some one of the dishes
about you for chips and scraps.</p>

<p>The fork is used in general except with semi-liquid
sauces, where a spoon is of necessity used.
It is not permissible to eat peas with a spoon.</p>

<p>The mouth should be closed while it contains
food. It should not be too full, as it is often
necessary to reply to some question when there
is food in the mouth.</p>

<p>Do not leave the table until you have quite
ceased chewing.</p>

<p>Be dainty and skillful in using your napkin
and cutlery, avoiding soiling the tablecloth.</p>

<p>Discussions and unpleasant topics of conversation
should never be introduced. One should
regard not only one's own aversions but those
of the others present.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><a href="images/36.png">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Never put your finger in your mouth at table,
nor pick your teeth.</p>

<p>Tidiness of personal appearance is never at a
higher premium than at the dining table.
Soiled hands, negligee dress, shirt sleeves, and
disheveled hair are disgusting there.</p>

<p>It is quite proper to take the last helping of
any dish which may be passed you. To refrain
looks as if you doubted the supply.</p>

<p>Bread is not cut, but broken into fairly small
pieces. One should never nibble from a large
piece.</p>

<p>It is permissible to eat crackers, olives, celery,
radishes, salted nuts, crystallized fruits, corn
on the cob, bonbons, and most raw fruits from
the fingers. Apples, pears, and peaches are
quartered, peeled, and then cut into small
pieces. Cherries, plums, and grapes are eaten
one by one, the stones being removed with the
fingers and laid upon the plate.</p>

<p>Cheese may be laid in small pieces on bread
or crackers, and conveyed to the mouth in that
way.</p>

<p>Asparagus should be eaten with the fork, the
part which is not readily broken off by it being
left.</p>

<p>At a formal meal a second helping of a dish
is never offered, and should never be asked for;
but at an informal dinner party it is not out of
place to accept a second helping, if one is of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><a href="images/37.png">[37]</a></span>fered,
but is complimentary to the hostess, who
is responsible for the cook.</p>

<p>In passing the plate for a second helping, the
knife and fork should be laid across it full
length,&mdash;not held in the hand until the plate
returns.</p>

<p>One may ask the waiter for a second or third
glass of water, as even at a formal dinner that
is always permissible.</p>

<p>Lettuce, cress, and chicory are never cut with
a knife, but rolled up on the fork and so conveyed
to the mouth.</p>

<p>Never leave the spoon in any cup while
drinking from it. Liquid bouillon,&mdash;not jellied,&mdash;should
be drunk from the bouillon cup.</p>

<p>Spoons are used for grape fruit and oranges,
when cut in halves and put upon a plate, for
soft-boiled eggs, puddings, custards, and gelatins.</p>

<p>With fruit, finger-bowls should always be
passed. A bowl half-full of water is placed
upon a plate covered with a doily. Unless the
fruit is passed upon a second plate, the bowl
and doily are removed from this and set at one
side, the fruit being eaten from this plate. The
fingers are then dipped, one hand at a time,
into the water, and wiped upon the napkin.</p>

<p>Salt should never be put upon the tablecloth,
but always on the side of the plate, unless the
individual salts are provided.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><a href="images/38.png">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Never spit out a prune, peach, or cherry
stone.</p>

<p>Never hold food on the fork while you are
talking, ready as soon as you reach a period to
be put into your mouth. Having once picked
it up, eat it promptly.</p>

<p>A bit of bread, but nothing else, may be used,
if necessary, to help one put food upon the fork.</p>

<p>If one tastes of something which one does not
care to swallow, it may be removed from the
mouth with the closed left hand and placed on
the plate. This should be done silently and
with as little attention as possible.</p>

<p>Never take a chicken or chop bone in the
fingers. Cut the meat from the bone, leaving
all that does not readily separate.</p>

<p>Bread and butter plates, with the butter
spreader, are always used, except at formal dinners,
when the dinner-roll is laid in the fold
of the napkin.</p>

<p>The knife is used only for cutting, and for
spreading butter on bread in the absence of
butter spreaders.</p>

<p>Almost all foods are eaten with the fork,
which should always be used in the right hand
with the tines up. It may be held in the left
hand, tines down, when one is cutting, the knife
being in the right hand.</p>

<p>The soup spoon is an almost circular and
quite deep spoon. Therefore it is obvious that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><a href="images/39.png">[39]</a></span>
the soup should be noiselessly sipped from the
side of it. When the oval dessert spoon is used
for soup, it is especially necessary to sip the
liquid from the side.</p>

<p>Special spoon-shaped forks are provided for
salads, ices, and creams, but for these spoons
may always be substituted.</p>

<p>No hot drink should be poured from the cup
into the saucer to cool it.</p>

<p>Toothpicks should not be passed at the table.
They may be left on the sideboard, and if one
is needed, it may be requested of the waiter
or taken as you leave the room, but always used
in private.</p>

<p>Wherein elderly people do differently from
the established ways of to-day, they are not to
be criticised. Manners change even several
times within a generation, and such may be
simply following the customs they were taught.
When the three-tined fork was the only one in
common use, the blade of the knife was much
more in requisition than now.</p>

<p>On leaving the table the dishes of the last
course should be left exactly as used, and the
napkin left unfolded by the side of the plate.
In case one is at home, or visiting a friend, and
the napkins usually serve for two or three
meals, then neatly fold it. Many families have
clean napkins once a day, that is, at dinner.</p>

<p>The chair should either be pushed quite back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><a href="images/40.png">[40]</a></span>
from the table, or close to it, so that others may
easily pass by.</p>

<p>If obliged to leave the table in the midst of
a meal, one should address the hostess, saying,
"Please excuse me," as he rises.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Anniversaries</i></div>

<p>The observance of family festivals is a great
bond of union when there are different ages and
temperaments and interests represented in the
family circle. In the home holidays, all meet
on a common ground, and get once more into
touch with each other. Yet the observance of
such festivals should never be more elaborate
than the purse will justify, nor should it be
allowed to become a burden upon any one, even
the most willing. The festive spirit is lost if
it becomes obligatory.</p>

<p>The observance of wedding anniversaries is
usually an honored custom in the case of happy
marriages, where children grow up who take
delight in making much of the days which are
sacred to their parents. Where this observance
is not a matter of form or done with any ulterior
motive, but is spontaneous and joyous, it
adds much to the family happiness and
strengthens the bonds, not only between
parents but between parents and children.</p>

<p>It is customary to make gifts of the sort signified<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><a href="images/41.png">[41]</a></span>
in the name of the anniversary, and much
ingenuity can be exercised in carrying out the
idea. The anniversaries are named as follows:</p>

<p>At the end of the first year comes a cotton
wedding; at the end of the second, a paper
wedding; the third, a linen wedding; the fifth,
a wooden; the tenth, a tin wedding; the fifteenth,
a crystal; the twentieth, linen; the
twenty-fifth, silver; the thirtieth, pearl; fortieth,
ruby; fiftieth, a golden wedding; and the
sixtieth, a diamond wedding.</p>

<p>These anniversaries may be added to, as by
celebrating a leather wedding the third year,
instead of two of linen; a woolen one the
seventh; and a china one the twelfth.</p>

<p>A birthday anniversary is a momentous
event in the life of a child. Disregard of it is
a heart-breaking slight. The celebrations of
these events, even in families where they are
numerous and resources few, can be made joyous
if there is love enough to do it, even without
money.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Giving of Presents</i></div>

<p>The members of a family who have each
other's welfare at heart, often have the impulse
to give each other something which they may
know is needed or wanted. While this impulse
should be cultivated even with the most limited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><a href="images/42.png">[42]</a></span>
means, and the sense of generosity preserved
even among the poorest,&mdash;where, to be frank,
it is more apt to be found than among the rich,&mdash;there
should be no counting upon such presents,
nor obligation to make them imposed.
This destroys their value as expressions of affection,
and makes the custom harmful. For
that reason it is not well to adhere to times
and seasons, but at any time when the right
opportunity offers and the impulse moves, give
the gift that one desires to give.</p>

<p>Where such an impulse is characteristic of
a family, the members will naturally take
pride in expressing in that way their appreciation
of individual achievement, as when a member
graduates from a high school or college, or
attains his majority, or makes some special advance
in any way. The spirit which welcomes
achievement and recognizes it, becomes an incentive,
perhaps the strongest there is, and
surely the most noble, that of satisfying and
pleasing a loved one. Life holds too much of
defeat for the average person, for its minor victories
to be passed over in silence and indifference.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Intimate Friends</i></div>

<p>One's attitude toward intimate friends is
either a pleasant memory or a sad revelation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><a href="images/43.png">[43]</a></span>
If one holds them a little lower than one's
family, and expends upon them effort to charm
second only to the effort habitually given to
those whom one loves, then intimacy becomes
a privilege, no matter what the circumstances,
and a lifelong gratification and pleasure. If,
however, one considers that intimate friends are
entitled to less courtesy than the public, and are
to be made to serve one's purpose more effectually
than mere acquaintances do, then the burden
of friendship is great, and soon dropped.
Affection is not mercenary.</p>

<p>One word in regard to the single monopolizing
friendship. Many a marriage has been
wrecked, and many a mother's friendship
turned away, because some one friend, of about
one's own age and tastes, of pronounced influence
and exorbitant demands, has usurped, at
first perhaps unconsciously but ever surely, the
place in one's life, and at last in one's heart,
that some member of the family should have
taken.</p>

<p>Some people seem naturally predisposed to
this sort of friendship, and as soon as the intellectual
zest is gone from absorbing companionship
with one person, they turn to another.
One such instance showed through
twenty years a series of such friendships on the
part of a well-meaning but foolish woman, in
which her husband figured briefly, passing on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><a href="images/44.png">[44]</a></span>
and off the stage as violently as, and even
more speedily than, the other "friends."</p>

<p>Too great familiarity with new acquaintances
is impolite as well as unwise. It cannot
fail of seeming forced, and even if the friendship
is to be close and permanent, a hastily-laid
foundation is never the most secure.</p>

<p>One should never call a friend by his Christian
name until he requests one to do so.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Illness in the Home</i></div>

<p>Illness means that the order of the home life
must be seriously disturbed. Consideration
for the one who is ill, and effort to alleviate the
suffering, should take the place of every other
thought and ambition. It is necessary, of
course, that the routine of living should be sufficiently
preserved for the health of the others
not to be affected, but matters of comfort and
well-being for all take precedence of everything
else.</p>

<p>The well should make all wise sacrifices for
the sake of the ill, such as being quiet about the
house; never complaining at late or simple
meals; setting aside personal plans and comfort
in order to assist, if needed, in the care of
the ill; looking out for the relief and comfort
of the nurse, upon whom the major part of the
responsibility rests; never grudging time or
money in the effort to restore health; and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><a href="images/45.png">[45]</a></span>
above all, making these sacrifices in the spirit
of love and not in that of martyrdom. Many
people, who make even unreasonable sacrifices
for others in times of emergency, do it so ungraciously,
that one does not feel that they are
entitled to the thanks which they still actually
deserve and should receive.</p>

<p>Courtesy demands that the claims of the
nurse and doctor be settled promptly and generously.
They were prompt in meeting the
emergency. There should be no delay in acknowledging
the obligation to them, even
though their promptness is looked upon, by
them and by society, as part of their professional
duty.</p>

<p>The convalescent takes such abnormally keen
delight in being remembered, that it is obligatory
upon the rest of his family and his friends
not to forget him. Kindly messages should be
frequent. Trifling gifts frequently are better
than large gifts occasionally, unless the large
gift is something greatly desired.</p>

<p>One should never fail to offer the easiest and
best seat in the room to an invalid, an elderly
person, or a lady.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Courtesy to Servants</i></div>

<p>It is safe to predict that, if the acumen of
the business man, and the courtesy of the social
leader and woman of true refinement were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><a href="images/46.png">[46]</a></span>
brought to bear upon the servant problem, that
would soon assume a different aspect.</p>

<p>If the consideration that would be shown an
ailing guest were shown an ailing servant, service
would be more generously and more faithfully
rendered.</p>

<p>The waitress at the table is entitled to courtesy,
but not to apologetic efforts to diminish
her task. Appreciation may be shown in a
"Thank you," or, "If you please," but such
notice of her should be unobtrusively spoken, so
as not to interfere with the general conversation
about the table.</p>

<p>The servant has every human right to civility,
and the withholding of wages is no more culpable,
if more illegal, than is the withholding
of civil treatment, and the infliction of the indignity
of impatience and harsh and unmerited
reproof.</p>

<p>All servants need careful training.</p>

<p>Neatness is the first requisite. The lack of it
most seriously reflects upon the management of
the household.</p>

<p>Servants should be trained to answer the
door-bell promptly, reply civilly to questions,
and in all things represent their master and
mistress in a dignified and courteous way.
They should not admit one person who calls
socially, and deny another, unless under special
and exceptional orders. They should not fail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><a href="images/47.png">[47]</a></span>
to deliver promptly all notes, messages, and
cards which may be received. Verbal messages
should be received and given with accuracy.</p>

<p>The direct neglect of orders is unpardonable
in an intelligent servant who has been well
trained, and will not occur, even in the absence
of the mistress, if the training has been
explicit and complete and the servant is honorable,&mdash;as
he should be in order to retain any
position. A certain degree of initiative, too,
should be cultivated in a servant who is given
responsibility, so that he may meet an emergency
with resourcefulness, in the absence of
orders or specific instructions.</p>

<p>The servant needs to respect his master and
mistress. The firm, strong, honest, and just
control is respected by servants, and is much
preferred to the irresolute one, even when the
latter overflows frequently in lax kindness.
Each man needs to be made to do his duty, and
the power that forces him to do it should be
gracious but must be firm.</p>

<p>To be familiar with servants is a fatal mistake,
and eventually upsets and destroys all discipline.</p>

<p>Servants should never be reproved in the presence
of guests, or members of the family, or
other servants, but should be talked with singly,
and considerately, but plainly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><a href="images/48.png">[48]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>CONVERSATION AND CORRESPONDENCE</h3>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Art of Conversation</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Conversation</span> is a game we all play, but
most of us with ill success. We do not take
pains to learn the rules, and we do not consider
the honor of winning sufficiently great. It is,
however, an accomplishment that all who will
may possess, that consumes a great deal of the
time of all of us, and that yields great pleasure
and profit if skillfully used.</p>

<p>The subject of conversation should be pertinent,
and of interest to all, or at least the
majority, of those in the group of talkers. The
treasures of experience and of knowledge should
be grouped about the topic, and every one who
contributes should take care to proffer nothing
that the conversation has not logically called
forth. Then the pleasure and the success of
the time thus spent is measured only by the
wit and mental resources of the talkers.</p>

<p>News which has a universal interest is always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><a href="images/49.png">[49]</a></span>
a legitimate subject of discussion. Personal
news which has only the interest of gossip
or scandal is never permitted among cultured
people, no more than are physiological
facts or the records of criminology. It is a safe
rule to speak of things rather than of persons.</p>

<p>The brilliant conversationalist never monopolizes
the talk, as such a method would prevent
his most telling points or his keenest wit from
having dramatic expression. If he tells an anecdote
which holds the attention of the table or
of the circle of listeners, he permits his duller
neighbor to tell the next, not only that his own
wit may have a foil, but that his next anecdote
may meet the sharp edge of whetted appetites.</p>

<p>If dining out or being entertained, do not
play the host or hostess by leading the conversation,
even though your talent in that direction
be far superior to theirs. You thereby do
them an injustice which is exceedingly discourteous
on the part of one who has accepted
of hospitality.</p>

<p>Never interrupt. It kills the expression of
any thought to interrupt the speaker, and every
person, no matter how badly he may express
himself, has a right to the effort and to what he
can win of the hearer's attention.</p>

<p>To supply a word which seems to fail the
speaker is perhaps a friendly service, if he be a
foreigner, but should never be tendered to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><a href="images/50.png">[50]</a></span>
countryman, nor often to even the most grateful
wrestler with the English language. It confuses
any one, and the only polite way is to
wait quietly until the speaker collects himself
and finds his words.</p>

<p>Do not contend any point. Among intelligent
people questions may be pleasantly and
earnestly debated, arguments weighed and
tested, and yet the conversation be absolutely
courteous, although conviction be deep on both
sides. The impossibility, among untrained
people, of debate without great emotion is
what retards the progress of the intellectual life
in many circles.</p>

<p>One should never answer questions in general
company that have been put to another.</p>

<p>One should not note the points of discrepancy
in the remarks of another, or the points of divergence
in opinion. In society the subjects of
conversation are subordinated to the human interest
of the gathering, and points of harmony
and agreement should be emphasized, leaving
all others unnoted. One does not need to conceal
his opinions, but he should not arrogantly
or dogmatically publish them. Not opinions but
individuals are of greater interest at that time,
and the battle of ideas should be fought in another
arena.</p>

<p>This is the only safe rule to follow in mixed
companies, or with people imperfectly trained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><a href="images/51.png">[51]</a></span>
socially. With highly intelligent people of congenial
tastes, people who have ideas and convictions
of great worth, and who are controlled
enough to express them without undue or foolish
emotion, the battle of ideas is fought most
effectively and most to the benefit of society,
in the drawing-room of that host and hostess
whose own talents make them able to draw
talent about them.</p>

<p>Here all the rules of polite society may be
observed, and yet the inner convictions, whether
political, religious, or moral, of the circle, may
find welcome expression and fair hearing. The
growth of ideas and the progress of ideals in
such a society is rapid and along the right lines.</p>

<p>Never try to have the last word, but always
refrain from saying it.</p>

<p>Do not enter into t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te conversation in
the presence of others, or refer to any topic of
conversation which is not of common interest
and commonly known. Mysterious allusions
or assumed understandings with one or two
members of a group are insults to the others.</p>

<p>Inquiries into private affairs should never
be made, but those on the subjects of age and
income are especially obnoxious, and merit for
the inquirer the cool silence which they usually
obtain.</p>

<p>The loud-voiced, aggressive person, whose
opinions are alone of vital moment in his estimation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><a href="images/52.png">[52]</a></span>
and who will not yield a point in an
argument, is much to be dreaded in any company,
and effectually brings to an end any general
conversation into which he intrudes.</p>

<p>When addressing people face to face, it is
necessary to give them their social or professional
titles, if the latter be such as have influence
on social rank, no matter if such titles are
not inscribed on the visiting card of the person
possessing them, or are purely honorary.</p>

<p>It is not now customary to add "Madam," or
"Sir," or the colloquial equivalent of the
former,&mdash;"m'am" or "m'm,"&mdash;to "Yes"
and "No," even by children.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Correspondence</i></div>

<p>Letter writing is a high art, and can give
great pleasure to one's friends. It must not,
however, be intemperately indulged in, either
in frequency, length of letters, or freedom of
expression. A timely note is a great binder
of friendship, and may give comfort and satisfaction
much greater than a longer letter at a
less important moment.</p>

<p>The danger of letter writing is that one is
tempted to pour out one's inmost feelings with
thoughtless abandon, and find later that the
relative or friend to whom the letter was addressed
was unworthy of the confidence, or, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><a href="images/53.png">[53]</a></span>
not unworthy, was repelled by it, or indiscreet
in guarding it. It is always wise for one to
restrain his expression of himself, when writing
or speaking, within the bounds of dignity and
a self-respecting reserve.</p>

<p>The classic letters of literature are usually
those the fervor of expression and self-revelation
of which gave them a strong human interest,
but in the preservation and publication of
which sacred confidence was violated. The
average letter of the average man or woman is
by no means a classic, or worthy of preservation.
It should be destroyed when it has fulfilled
the immediate purpose for which it was
written. It may otherwise sometime be instrumental
in bringing ridicule, if not shame, upon
the unsuspecting writer.</p>

<p>As letter writing is the most common form of
composition, the general rules pertaining to that
art should be observed in even the most informal
of letters.</p>

<p>All letters should be concise and definite.
An involved style is a great waste of time and
mental power, and has no advantage.</p>

<p>A letter should be written on consecutive
pages, unless it be very short, in which case it
is preferable to use the first and third, rather
than only the first and second, pages. It should
never be written so that the sheet has to be
turned around and the pages read at different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><a href="images/54.png">[54]</a></span>
angles. The turning over of the pages should
be all that is necessary.</p>

<p>If, however, social note paper is used for a
short business letter to a business man, open the
sheet out flat, turn it so that the left side becomes
the top of the sheet, and use as you would
a single large sheet of commercial paper. This
enables the reader to see the whole matter at a
glance.</p>

<p>Do not scrawl your letter over the page; but
do not, on the other hand, appear to economize
in paper. Make the place and date lines clear
and distinct. Set off the salutation from the
body of the letter, and make the form of the
letter upon the page artistic and concise.
Paper is cheap, and the delight of receiving a
letter well framed in even margins and written
on regular, if invisible, lines is a pleasure easily
afforded a friend.</p>

<p>The letter should be begun about two inches
down from the upper edge of the paper. The
left-hand margin should be three-quarters of an
inch, with paragraph indention an inch more.
The lower margin also should be three-quarters
of an inch, and the right margin should be kept
even and, for best effect, almost as wide as the
left margin.</p>

<p>Do not run on the letter without paragraphing
it, but place each subject in a paragraph by itself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><a href="images/55.png">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>A business letter should always go straight
to the point.</p>

<p>A note of apology should be direct, and say
but the one thing which is its subject.</p>

<p>A note asking a favor should do it simply
and without unnecessary preamble. The sense
of freedom or intimacy which permits one to
ask a favor, should be great enough to obviate
the necessity of long explanation, which seems
like coaxing.</p>

<p>The refusal of a request requires tact, and
may necessitate less directness than courteous
explanation: but it should not be so extended
as to be apologetic.</p>

<p>A letter of thanks is difficult, but too great
effusiveness is as disgusting as too great abruptness
is unsatisfactory. The elusive but happy
medium is the work of the socially well-trained.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Paper</i></div>

<p>The grade of paper used is a matter of no
small moment. Some people affect a fastidiousness
in color and quality quite out of keeping
with the purpose to which the paper is to be
put. Others affect an opposite slovenliness,
which shows equal disregard of use and effectiveness.</p>

<p>A good quality of paper is essential to elegance.
Plain white or cream white paper, unlined,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><a href="images/56.png">[56]</a></span>
with either rough or smooth finish, is
always correct, and is the only kind for formal
social correspondence. For more intimate letters
ladies sometimes use a pale blue, delicate
pearl-gray, light lavender or heliotrope, or a
Colonial buff. There has lately been imported
the style of an envelope with lining of another
color and paper to match, in a variety of bright
tints and striking designs. These styles, even
in the daintier variations of them, appeal only
to the younger members of the "smart set."
Gentlemen never use any but white stationery.</p>

<p>Correspondence cards are a great convenience
for the very shortest of messages, where even
the small note paper is too large. They are to
social letter writing what the postal is in business.
They, like the postal, should be used
only for brief messages of no special importance,
or for notifications.</p>

<p>It is a matter of taste and of expense to have
one's monogram or home address engraved at
the top of choice note paper or letter paper.
This may be in gilt, silver, or colors.</p>

<p>The more common forms of heading are centered
an inch below the top of the paper, but
may be placed somewhat lower down, and to the
right, leaving about three-quarters of an inch
margin. In this case the date line follows.
Engraved and embossed headings are the most
elegant, and printed ones should be used only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><a href="images/57.png">[57]</a></span>
for business purposes. There can, however, be
no objection to a very neatly printed small heading
for personal business correspondence, if it
is tastefully done in a quiet color. While it
would not be acceptable for formal social correspondence,
it does very well on more intimate
letters and saves the necessity of writing each
time the home address. It is best to use printed
letterheads, rather than commit the blunder now
so common, among those who do not habitually
use engraved paper, of omitting the address
from the letter. This, in case the letter is misdirected,
and travels to the Dead-<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'letter'">Letter</ins> Office,
prevents effectually its restoration to the writer.</p>

<p>The size of note paper suited to the letter to
be written should be used. Do not start with
a small note size, and run on over several sheets.
The letter size should have been taken in the
first place, as the note is only for such messages
as are essentially short.</p>

<p>The forms of heading which are permissible
at the top of the personal letter paper are the
following: a crest, monogram, or the separate
initials; the name of the home if, as an estate,
it has a special title; the name of the city and
state; or the street address, with the name of
the city and state beneath.</p>

<p>When in mourning, it is customary to use a
note paper and envelopes surrounded with a
narrow black border. The border should not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><a href="images/58.png">[58]</a></span>
exceed three-eighths of an inch in width, and
three-sixteenths of an inch during the period
of half mourning. Sometimes only a black line
with the monogram is used.</p>

<p>Scented note paper is not in good taste, except
perhaps that which has a very faint odor
of violets or of orris root, or, in the Southland,
of orange blossoms.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Ink</i></div>

<p>Colored inks are not liked or approved of by
society. A good blue-black ink is the best for
all writing.</p>

<p>Pale inks, too faint to be easily seen, and
too lacking in stock to last any length of time,
are useless.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Handwriting</i></div>

<p>Illegibility in handwriting, or a stilted and
difficult hand, is a great waste of time and
energy, mainly the would-be reader's. There
is no excuse, in these days of the typewriter and
of common knowledge of stenography, for an
illegible letter or manuscript, and the carelessness
which writes too hurriedly to form the
letters is excusable only in the gravest emergency
and between intimate friends, where the
inconvenience caused by it will be, for personal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><a href="images/59.png">[59]</a></span>
reasons, gladly forgiven. Some handwritings
which are thoroughly legible are extremely
tiring to the reader, and the simpler, less ornate
hand is for every purpose preferable.</p>

<p>The affectation of a handwriting which enables
you to put but few words on a page, is
absurd and vulgar in the extreme. Yet, on the
other hand, a too delicate or minute hand is
not desirable. Legibility, neatness, and clearness
are the salient virtues of a letter.</p>

<p>The use of the typewriter is confined to business.
It is still very bad form to use it for personal
letters; but should elegant script and
small, clear forms of type, such as are furnished
by one or two of the machines now on
the market, be in common use, there is little
doubt but what the speed of service and the
advantages of clearness would bring the typewriter
into use in intimate, and perhaps at last
into more formal, social correspondence. The
tendency seems to lie in that direction.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Sealing, Stamping, and Directing Envelopes</i></div>

<p>Neatness is especially necessary in the folding
of letters, and in addressing, stamping, and
sealing the envelopes. Haste and slovenliness
here take away the suggestion of compliment
in the courtesy of the note, and are as insulting
as any rudeness of manner can well be.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><a href="images/60.png">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The fastidious and leisurely still seal their
envelopes with wax, imprinting thus their
monogram. The well-gummed envelope now in
vogue makes this superfluous for the ordinary
informal letter. Addresses should be written
with an eye to legibility, and the stamp should
be affixed to the upper right-hand corner of the
envelope with care and neatness. Social invitations,
although engraved and therefore containing
no handwriting, should always be sent
with letter postage.</p>

<p>Letters should be plainly and completely addressed
to insure their safe and prompt delivery.</p>

<p>Persons who have a large business correspondence
should use for it envelopes on which
their name and post office address are printed
in the upper left-hand corner. In social correspondence
these should be clearly written or
engraved upon the back of the envelope.</p>

<p>Sometimes where a business firm is small or
little known, it facilitates the delivery of a
business letter to place the number of the office
room in a building upon the envelope. Where,
however, the firm is so large that probably the
entire mail is carried from the post office in
bags, or where a post office box is doubtless
made use of instead of the carriers' delivery,
even the street number is superfluous. Letters
for departments should be so marked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><a href="images/61.png">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>If the city is one of the largest in the country,
the name of the state is not added; as,
New York City, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia
would stand alone.</p>

<p>Only a business letter should have the word
"City" in place of the name of the city, and
it is better to write the name, omitting, if you
choose, the state. This is permissible only when
the central post office is used, as the postmark
of any suburban station might cause confusion,
and railway post office clerks, especially, should
not be expected to guess accurately the intents
of a writer.</p>

<p>When street addresses like "Broadway,"
"Park Row," "Aborn Drive," are written, it
is superfluous to write "St." after them.</p>

<p>The older form of writing an address was to
end each line with a comma. The more recent
style, and one coming into quite common use,
is to omit the comma, using only such punctuation
as the sense of the words within the line
demands. Either way is permissible.</p>

<p>Uniformity and concise clearness are characteristics
of a well-written address. An address
should be written as follows:</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="A Well-written address">
<tr><td align='left'>Mr. Frankel Banchman,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><span style="margin-left: 2em;">15 Westland Avenue,</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><span style="margin-left: 3em;">Philadelphia,</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Pa.</span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><a href="images/62.png">[62]</a></span></p>
<p>If the directions are to be included, then the
following arrangement is better:</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="An address with directions">
<tr><td align='left'><span style="margin-left: 4em;">Mrs. Arthur L. Casson,</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><span style="margin-left: 6em;">North Maplewood,</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><span style="margin-left: 8em;">Chestnut County,</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Care of Mr. Hiram Casson. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N. Y.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The sign of per cent is no longer used to signify
"care of."</p>

<p>A clergyman is addressed "The Reverend
John L. Wrigley, D. D.," or, less correctly,
"Rev. John L. Wrigley, D. D.," which may be
transposed to "Rev. Dr. John L. Wrigley."
The omission of the article before the word
"Reverend" is quite common.</p>

<p>A physician is properly addressed, "Algernon
Brigham, M. D.," and the salutation is
"Dear Dr. Brigham," or "Dear Doctor," if he
is an intimate friend. A man having the title
of Doctor with any other significance than that
of Doctor of Medicine, is usually addressed
"Dr. Frederic V. Harlan." A very formal
way, however, would be to address such a one,&mdash;supposing
each of the titles to be his,&mdash;as
"Professor Frederic V. Harlan, Ph. D." For
the letter, the salutations "Dear Professor Harlan"
and "Dear Dr. Harlan" are equally correct.</p>

<p>A letter to the President of the United States<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><a href="images/63.png">[63]</a></span>
should be addressed simply with that title and
with no further specification of name, whether
it be official or social: as, "To the President of
the United States, Executive Mansion, Washington,
D. C." The salutation should be simply
"Sir." The conclusion should be, "I have the
honor to remain Your obedient servant." If a
social letter it may be addressed either formally
or "To the President of the United States,
(Christian name and surname), Executive
Mansion," etc. The salutation would then be
"My dear Mr. President."</p>

<p>The Vice President should be addressed
officially in the same form; that is, "To the
Vice President, Hon. Chester A. Arthur." He
should be saluted, officially, "Mr. Vice President,
Sir;" socially, "My dear Mr. Arthur."</p>

<p>In addressing the governor of a state the
superscription should be, "To His Excellency,
The Governor of Massachusetts, State House,
Boston." The salutation should be "Sir," if
official, but "Dear Governor Barnard," if social.
The conclusion of an official letter should read,
"I have the honor to be, Sir, Your Excellency's
most obedient servant."</p>

<p>The mayor of a city is addressed, "To His
Honor, The Mayor of Chicago." Within, he is
saluted officially as "Your Honor," socially as
"My dear Mayor Sewall."</p>

<p>Ambassadors of any country, whatever their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><a href="images/64.png">[64]</a></span>
personal distinction, may be given the title of
"Honorable," and their rank placed after the
surname. As, "Honorable Whitelaw Reid,
Ambassador to the Court of St. James." They
may always be addressed as "Your Excellency."</p>

<p>The members of the Cabinet of the President
of the United States are always addressed as
"Honorable," and the name of their department,
or their title added: as, "The Honorable,
The Secretary of State." To give the name
would be superfluous, as in the case of the
President. On formal invitations, however,
when the Secretary and his wife are entertaining,
the form is, "The Secretary of State and
Mrs. Hay request the honor," etc.</p>

<p>Invitations which come to one because of his
official position are not intended for personal
compliments, hence are addressed to the office,
not to the man personally.</p>

<p>An invitation from the President of the
United States is equal to a command, and may
not be declined. Other engagements must be
broken for it, and only grave calamity or illness
should excuse one, the excuse being frankly
stated instead of mere formal expressions of
regret.</p>

<p>In ceremonious notes abbreviations should
never be used.</p>

<p>Should one address the ruler of England, the
superscription would be, "His Majesty, The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><a href="images/65.png">[65]</a></span>
King, London." The salutation would be,
"Sir;" the conclusion, "I have the honor to be,
Sir, Your Majesty's most obedient servant."</p>

<p>"His Grace the Duke of Fife" is the form of
address for a Duke; "My Lord Duke" being
the salutation, and "Your Grace's most obedient
servant" the subscription.</p>

<p>In writing to the Pope of the Roman Catholic
Church, one should address the letter to "His
Holiness, Pope &mdash;&mdash;, Rome." The salutation
should be "Your Holiness," but the conclusion
remains the same form as for other dignitaries.
A Cardinal of the same church is addressed
"To His Eminence (Christian name) Cardinal
(surname)," and greeted as "Your Eminence."
Formality should be strictly observed.</p>

<p>An Archbishop of the Church of England is
addressed, "The Most Reverend (name) His
Grace the Lord Archbishop of (name of bishopric)."
The salutation is "My Lord Archbishop;"
the subscription, "I have the honor
to be, with the highest respect, Your Grace's
most humble servant." A Bishop is addressed
"The Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of
(name of diocese)." He is saluted "My Lord
Bishop."</p>

<p>In the United States the Bishops of the Protestant
Episcopal Church, who are not here
Lords, are addressed, singly, as "The Right
Reverend (Christian name and surname).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><a href="images/66.png">[66]</a></span>
D. D.," or "The Right Reverend Bishop of
(name of diocese)." They are saluted, singly,
"Most Reverend Sir."</p>

<p>The word "To" may precede a formal or
ceremonious address, adding to the formality.</p>

<p>An envelope containing a letter or card of
introduction should never be sealed, if presented
in person by the party introduced. If, however,
he should deliver it by messenger,&mdash;an exceptional
procedure, and one not to be followed by
a man except in unusual circumstances,&mdash;the
envelope may be sealed.</p>

<p>No letter sent through the kindness of a
friend should ever be sealed. The envelope
should bear, in the lower left-hand corner, the
acknowledgment of the favor in words like
"Kindness of Miss Hallowell."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Salutation, Conclusion, and Signature of Letters</i></div>

<p>A stranger should be saluted as follows:
"Mr. Eugene Motley, My dear Sir;" "Mrs.
Alonzo Parmenter, Dear Madam;" or "Eugene
Motley, Esq., My dear Sir." These are
forms slightly more formal than "My dear Mr.
Motley," or "My dear Mrs. Parmenter," which
in America are strangely considered more
formal than "Dear Mr. Motley," or "Dear
Mrs. Parmenter," although in England the
reverse is true. Therefore, a mere acquaintance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><a href="images/67.png">[67]</a></span>
is addressed "My dear Mrs. Judson,"
while a friend is addressed "Dear Mr. Clark."</p>

<p>A married woman signs her name, as "Ethel
Husted," and then puts her formal name,
"Mrs. Hollis Husted," in brackets a little to
the left of and a little below the other.</p>

<p>Never sign a title. The name only is your
signature. It may be necessary to write the
title in brackets and at the left, as "(Miss)"
or "(Mrs.)," but it should never be part of the
signature. Such notes as demand the use of
the title are put in the third person.</p>

<p>The date should be at the end of a social
note, in the lower left-hand corner, and should
be written out, with the name of the year
omitted and no figures used. The grammatical
form is "The ninth of December," never "December
the ninth," nor "December ninth."</p>

<p>In business letters the salutation for a firm
name is "Dear Sir," or "Gentlemen." Where
two married women go into business together,
there seems to be in English no combined title
to take the place of the French, so that is generally
used, and that is "Mesdames," abbreviated
"Mmes." before their names.</p>

<p>The formal conclusions of letters are: "Respectfully
yours," used to a superior; "Sincerely
yours," or "Truly yours," used largely
in business, or the same forms with the adverb
"Very" preceding them. Less formal terms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><a href="images/68.png">[68]</a></span>
are: "Cordially yours," "Fraternally yours,"
or the pronoun with any appropriate adverb
which the originality of the writer may suggest.
Less abrupt, but not less formal, endings are:
"With best regards, I am," etc.; "With kindest
regards, I remain," etc.; "Believe me
Very sincerely yours."</p>

<p>For intimate letters either to relatives or
friends no specified suggestions are needed.
The ordinary form, "Your affectionate
daughter," or "niece," etc., may, however, be
employed, in dearth of special inspiration.</p>

<p>Distinction is sometimes made between business
and social letters by the position of "Yours,"&mdash;it
being placed before the adverb in social correspondence,
and after in business. The tone of
the letter may be left to guide in this matter.
There is an abruptness always somewhat unpleasant
in the use of the adverb alone.</p>

<p>Make the beginning and ending of a letter
the same in degree of cordiality. Do not begin
formally "My dear Madam," and end "Cordially
yours."</p>

<p>Every letter should be signed with the full
name of the writer. A possible exception might
be made of those addressed to members of one's
own family, where the use of the Christian
name only would mean no ambiguity, or where
the signing of the surname gives a touch of
formality. It is well, however, to remember<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><a href="images/69.png">[69]</a></span>
that letters placed in the post take the chances
of fortune, and, with the plainest of addresses,
may, by the absence of the person or for some
other cause, bring up in the Dead-Letter Office.
Their resurrection there will depend upon their
containing the full name of the sender as well
as his address. If a letter is valuable enough
to send, it is valuable enough to sign, even if
the signature be double,&mdash;first the familiar or
given name, and then, in the lower left-hand
corner, the full name.</p>

<p>It is well to use always the name which is
your legal signature. This will prevent confusion,
and forestall the possibility of your putting,
from force of habit, the wrong form of
your name upon a legal document.</p>

<p>It is well to write one's name in full. Three
complete names are none too many for individual
distinction in so crowded a world as is ours.
If, however, the middle one is represented by
an initial only, always write it uniformly. It
is better, if the form with initial only has not
become really established, to use the full name,
although it may be long.</p>

<p>The form of one's signature and the style of
the handwriting soon become habitual. Therefore,
every effort should be made to make and
keep it legible. An illegible signature is unpardonable,&mdash;save
perhaps on a page at the
top of which a printed or engraved letterhead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><a href="images/70.png">[70]</a></span>
gives the name in full. There is, however, the
danger that the writer of the illegible signature
will sometime sign his name on a legal document,
or a sheet not bearing his letterhead, and
the signature stand for nothing.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Letters of Introduction</i></div>

<p>A letter of introduction should never be requested.
If it is offered it is a sign of great
regard. If it is greatly desired, it might be
well to acquaint the person, in whose power it
is to offer it, with the circumstances and interests
which make it desirable, but never to do
more than this.</p>

<p>The advisability of giving letters of introduction
depends upon the circumstances. Between
business acquaintances and for business
purposes, it is a common form of establishing
connection among various interests, and, if done
with discrimination, is to be approved. It
should, however, even in business be done
sparingly, as it is a matter of personal friendship,
usually, and as no one has a right to
make numerous or exacting demands upon one's
friends.</p>

<p>Socially it is a matter of great delicacy, and
should have even more restrictions put upon it
than does the introduction in company. For
the written introduction is used because distance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><a href="images/71.png">[71]</a></span>
prevents the personal one, and that usually
throws the recipient of such a letter into the
position of host to the traveler or newcomer,
or at least of benefactor to some degree. It
places upon him an obligation not involved in
the verbal introduction, and the presumption
is that he is to do some favor, or show some
special attention.</p>

<p>Letters of introduction may be explanatory
or brief. Brevity is preferable, but circumstances
must determine.</p>

<p>A visiting card is often used with the words
"Introducing Mr. Allan Golding to Mr. Morris,"
or similar form, written across the top.
The card should be enclosed in a small envelope
and left unsealed.</p>

<p>A brief form of letter simply says: "Permit
me to introduce to your favorable notice Mr.
Silas Emerson."</p>

<p>A more explicit form would be a letter the
body of which would resemble the following:</p>

<p>"The bearer, Mr. Mark W. Allen, who is an
old friend and neighbor of mine, represents the
Altmann Irrigation Company, and is desirous
of obtaining information in regard to the system
of waterways lately put into your county.
Knowing your influential position in regard to
all matters of public interest, I have sent him
to you in the hope that you may be able to put
him in touch with the people who will give him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><a href="images/72.png">[72]</a></span>
the desired information. Any favor that you
may do Mr. Allen, or any courtesy that you
may extend to him, will be deeply appreciated
by me."</p>

<p>A purely social letter of introduction would
say in substance: "Mrs. Arthur L. Westmore,
who presents this letter to you, is an intimate
and cherished friend of mine, and one whom I
know you would desire to meet. She is to
spend some little time in your city, and any
courtesy that you may do her I shall deeply
appreciate. I have told her of our friendship,
and she knows how highly I value you, and is
eager to meet you."</p>

<p>When a letter of introduction is given, it is
well to write the receiver concerning the friend
who will present it, that he may not be taken
unawares, nor continue long ignorant of the
claims of that friend upon him.</p>

<p>A gentleman usually presents such a letter
by calling in person and sending in the letter,
together with one of his personal cards, by the
servant who answers the bell, or by the office
boy. A lady usually mails the letter and one
of her cards giving her address. She should
receive an acknowledgment with a call or offer
of hospitality within a day or two.</p>

<p>A person who makes use of a letter of introduction
should acknowledge to the giver the
courtesy he has received, with due gratitude.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><a href="images/73.png">[73]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Letters of Recommendation</i></div>

<p>Letters of recommendation should be sparingly
given. It is becoming less and less important,
in the minds of experienced employers,
to demand references. The personality of the
applicant counts, and the varying traits which
different positions cultivate make the experiences
of the past of but little guidance, save
in a broad and general way.</p>

<p>The giving of recommendations at random,
"To whom it may concern," is also less done
than formerly, as there is such uncertainty in
regard to their use. Instead of this, the servant
is told that she may use the former mistress's
name as reference. The new, would-be employer
then writes a note of inquiry to the
former employer.</p>

<p>In replying to such a note great conscientiousness
should be shown. Full justice should
be done the servant. Only the truth should be
told, and as much of it as a generous heart
and wise conscience, coupled with a sense of
responsibility toward the inquirer, permit.
These letters should be brief and not effusive
on any point, nor evasive of the issue at stake.</p>

<p>Never write to another, asking for information,
or a favor of any kind, without enclosing
a stamped and addressed envelope for reply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><a href="images/74.png">[74]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Third-person Letters</i></div>

<p>Letters are written in the third person in answer
to formal invitations so worded, and in
correspondence between people but slightly acquainted
or known to each other only by reputation,
persons not social equals, and by tradespeople
and their patrons.</p>

<p>Great care should be taken to preserve the
impersonal diction throughout the letter, and to
refrain from signing it. The tone should always
be formal and very polite.</p>

<p>An order may take the form of a request, as
"Will Mr. Sutherland please .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and oblige,"
with the signature of the writer.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Informal Invitations and Announcements</i></div>

<p>In inviting a friend to visit you, it is customary
to mention the length of the visit, setting
a definite date for it and limit to it. This
makes it possible for both hostess and guest to
arrange other engagements.</p>

<p>A time-table of the trains, if the guest comes
from the distance, with an account of the trolley
lines, if from near at hand, should be enclosed.</p>

<p>The engagement of a daughter may be announced
by informal notes to one's whole circle
of friends and acquaintances. The following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><a href="images/75.png">[75]</a></span>
form of note may serve as a suggestion: "I am
sure that you will join our household in sympathy
with Eleanor in her happiness when I
tell you that she has just announced her engagement
to Mr. Harold Farnham, a man of whom
her father and I thoroughly approve. The wedding
will not take place for some months, but
felicitations are in order."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Letters of Condolence</i></div>

<p>A letter of condolence should be short and
quite sincere, or else the courteous custom of
sending it is more honored in the breach than
in the observance.</p>

<p>Such letters should be sent very promptly.</p>

<p>To expatiate to any extent whatever upon the
bereavement is heartless or thoughtless, and as
there is no danger of ambiguity, the letter does
not need to account for itself in any way.</p>

<p>The following letter is as explicit as any letter
of condolence need ever be, and the second
form is preferable, unless great intimacy makes
the less abrupt one permissible.</p>

<div class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Legrow</span>:<br />

<p>I have read of your bereavement with the
deepest sorrow. I cannot tell you how fully I
sympathize with you and your children, or how
my heart aches for you in your loneliness. May<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><a href="images/76.png">[76]</a></span>
you have strength and grace to bear up under
the great loss you have sustained.</p>

<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">Sincerely yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Margaret Edelstone</span>."<br />
</div>
<br />

"<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Hilcox</span>:

<p>You have my deepest sympathy.</p>

<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">Ever cordially yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Mildred Hasseltine</span>."<br />
</div></div>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Answering Letters</i></div>

<p>Business letters should be answered by return
mail, as should also all invitations to dinner or
luncheon.</p>

<p>All invitations should be answered within a
day if possible, because delay looks like a reluctance
to accept. They should certainly be
answered, either personally or by letter, within
a week after the invitation is received.</p>

<p>Friendly letters should have such promptness
of response as circumstances and the intimacy
of the friendship demand.</p>

<p>Notes of congratulation and felicitation
should be sent promptly after receiving the card
or note announcement of an engagement or a
birth, and in the latter case at least, should be
followed by a call.</p>

<p>A personal visiting card, with the words
"Thank you for sympathy" written over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><a href="images/77.png">[77]</a></span>
name, is sufficient acknowledgment of letters of
condolence. To very intimate friends, however,
the spontaneous note of thanks would be more
courteous. As it is almost impossible, at such
a time, to attend to matters of social intercourse,
the sending of the card is always permissible,
and can occasion no offense, even if the more
intimate acknowledgment was hoped for.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><a href="images/78.png">[78]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>CASUAL MEETINGS AND CALLS</h3>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Greetings and Recognitions</i></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bow and the handshake are the accepted
forms of greeting in the United States to-day.
The bow varies from a very slight inclination
of the head, as one gentleman passes another,
or from the quick touching of the hat with the
hand, in a sort of reminiscence of the military
salute, to the various degrees of elaborate bow
which savors of European ceremonial courtesy.</p>

<p>The usual form is a bending of the head and
shoulders, with the eyes kept on those of the
person greeted, the hat being removed from
the head and held in the right hand during the
bow,&mdash;which is at once brief, deferential, and
dignified. It may be accompanied by the handshake,
in which case the hat is lifted by the left
hand.</p>

<p>The degree of the depth of the bow is usually
spontaneous, determined by the deference felt,
or the emotions which the meeting may summon.
It is useless to bow low to conceal scorn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><a href="images/79.png">[79]</a></span>
or real disdain, for they are sure to reveal themselves
in the artificiality of the pose, or in the
carriage of the shoulders, or in the movement
of an eyelash, and usually nobody is deceived.</p>

<p>The correct position for an extreme bow is
with the feet near together, the legs straight,
and the entire body inclined from the hips.
This is somewhat too extreme for common use,
and should be modified always in public, the
less elaborate bow being much preferable upon
the street or in public places.</p>

<p>A woman bows more erectly than a man does,
and gives perhaps as cordial an impression by
the greater expressiveness of her greeting, which
should always be characteristic, and never mechanical,
or in imitation of others, whose natural
traits may be far different, however admirable
she may consider their style to be. It is only
when she meets some one her senior, or in much
more important social position, or one whom
she specially delights to honor, that she elaborates
her bow, or curtsies if not in public and
if the occasion admit of the formality.</p>

<p>A lady should be straightforward in her
greeting, never condescending to the coquettish
mannerism of letting the eyes fall during the
bow. She should sink her personal consciousness
in the fact of meeting another, and should
not intrude it into the intellectual interest of
such a meeting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><a href="images/80.png">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The handshake is accomplished by extending
the right hand horizontally from the elbow and
clasping, between the closed four fingers and
thumb of the hand, the closed four fingers of
the friend's right hand, then quietly shaking it.
This is sometimes varied by lifting the clasped
hands,&mdash;not the elbow,&mdash;to the height of the
shoulders, and there mildly shaking them, or
clasping them with a slight pressure and letting
them drop,&mdash;styles savoring of affectation.
The impulse prompting the handshake,&mdash;that
of getting together in intimate personal greeting,&mdash;is
accomplished when the clasp is ended,
and vigorous and prolonged shaking, or special
pressure, or continued holding of the hand, are
all alike unpardonable.</p>

<p>The bow is the least sign of recognition, and
may mean little or much, but its significance is
known only to the two concerned. While it is
permissible in public places to make its cordiality,
or lack of it, apparent, it is not permissible
to greet fellow guests at any private
social function with either more or less than a
uniform and impartial courtesy.</p>

<p>The bow does not mean that one has a calling
acquaintance. It may mean only a casual
knowledge of one another's existence, due to
some brief coming together. Intentionally to
neglect to bow, after a bowing acquaintance has
once been established, is an open affront, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><a href="images/81.png">[81]</a></span>
denotes either extreme rudeness or veiled insult.
The dropping of an acquaintance by refusal to
recognize, may, in our complicated social system,
sometimes be necessary, but it is only justified
by the necessity for society to safeguard
itself against some of the more flagrant social
abuses.</p>

<p>It is a woman's privilege, in meeting a man
whom she knows, to bow first. Indeed, the man
always waits for her to do so, unless he is a very
intimate friend. A woman should always be
sure, before bowing to a man, that she knows
him and that she has caught his eye.</p>

<p>When a gentleman is walking with a lady, he
lifts his hat when she bows to an acquaintance,
even if the person is not known to him. So,
also, when he is alone and meets a man whom
he knows, who is in the company of a lady, he
lifts his hat. When, walking with a lady, he
meets a gentleman whom he knows, he removes
his hat.</p>

<p>When a gentleman meets a party of ladies or
stops to speak with one only, it is customary for
him to retain his hat in his hand until she requests
him to replace it. This is done with
social superiors and to show great respect, being
more ceremonial than finds common acceptance
among Americans.</p>

<p>When he is with a gentleman who bows to a
lady, he also lifts his hat. It is proper for him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><a href="images/82.png">[82]</a></span>
to lift the hat when offering any courtesy to a
lady, even though a total stranger, and upon
leaving a lady with whom he or a person accompanying
him has been talking.</p>

<p>It is well to return a bow which is directed
to you, even if you do not know the one bowing.
This often saves considerable embarrassment to
the one who has for the moment mistaken you
for some one else.</p>

<p>When passing before ladies seated in a lecture
hall, or concert, a gentleman always asks
their pardon for troubling them.</p>

<p>In passing or repassing on the street or
promenade, a single bow is sufficient recognition,
even though you may meet an acquaintance
several times.</p>

<p>A lady, receiving in her own home, shakes
hands with the stranger with the same cordiality
as with the friend.</p>

<p>A gentleman when greeting a lady never
takes the initiative in hand-shaking. If a lady
offers her hand, however, it would be very rude
indeed for a gentleman not to accept the courtesy.</p>

<p>Persons who have met at the house of a
mutual friend, but have not been introduced,
are under no obligation to bow when they meet
elsewhere afterward, and usually do not.</p>

<p>When a man passes a lady on a staircase, in
the corridor of a hotel, in the elevator of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><a href="images/83.png">[83]</a></span>
private apartment house, or in the public rooms
of a hotel, he lifts his hat although she may be
a stranger.</p>

<p>This rule does not prevail on the staircases
and in the corridors of office buildings, with the
exception, perhaps, of banks and such offices as
people of wealth frequent; for a new fineness
of courtesy has made men feel that, as women
are winning an equality of position in the business
field, a delicate way of recognizing that
equality is by giving them a comradely deference
rather than paying them the social attentions.
Another marked expression of this is in
the fact that a business man, when walking on
the street with a business woman, does not interrupt
their conversation by changing sides with
her in order to keep constantly on the outside
of the walk.</p>

<p>An indication of the two kinds of courtesy,
social and business, is often grotesquely shown
when a woman in social life, perhaps the wife
of one of the men present, enters an office where
there are both men and women of equal business
importance and social rank. There is an
elaborate social courtesy paid to the wife, who
is in private life, which would not be paid, and
would seem grotesque and ill-mannered if paid,
to the business woman, even though she were at
once the active vice president of the corporation
and wife of the president.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><a href="images/84.png">[84]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Introductions</i></div>

<p>The usual form of introduction is, "Mrs.
Allen, may I present Mr. Brown?" Or, "Mrs.
Allen, let me present Mr. Brown." Or, "Mrs.
Caldwell, allow me to present Colonel Glazier."
Where, however, the permission need not be
suggested, and the relative standing of the
people is the same, the form may be only, "Mrs.
Gleason, Mr. Ansel."</p>

<p>When it is necessary to introduce one person
to several, the form is, "Mrs. Gladstone, I want
you to meet Mrs. Falmouth, Miss Washburn,
Mr. Cronkshaw, and Mr. Edgerton." The one
introduced simply repeats each name and smiles
as she greets each in turn.</p>

<p>Another form much in use is, "Miss Hanscom,
I want you to know my friend, Mr.
Thompson, the artist," and is preferable because
of its definiteness.</p>

<p>The response to an introduction is, "I am
happy to meet you," or, "I am very glad to
meet you."</p>

<p>If one does not catch the name of the person
introduced, it is proper to ask it, saying,
"Pardon me, but I did not understand the
name."</p>

<p>Introductions should always be spoken distinctly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><a href="images/85.png">[85]</a></span>especially the names. If, in introducing,
one can add a sentence which will give
a subject of conversation, the preliminaries of
acquaintance may be speedily passed, and memorable
information and real profit be gleaned
from even a casual meeting.</p>

<p>It is a mark of intelligence and social instinct
to be quick to catch and retain in memory a face
and name from even a brief introduction, and
the tacit compliment to the person so remembered
is apt to win his favor.</p>

<p>Persons who have not been introduced are not
considered acquainted. The exceptions to this
rule are the guests under a common roof, while
they are there.</p>

<p>Introductions should never be indiscriminately
made. There should be willingness, if
not eagerness, on the part of both to meet. A
hostess is, however, warranted in introducing
two people who she knows will be congenial, or
if they have before expressed a desire to become
acquainted. If any doubt exists as to how the
introduction will be received by either, they
should not be introduced.</p>

<p>One should never introduce two acquaintances
who reside in the same town but move in different
social circles, unless each had desired the
introduction.</p>

<p>If there is a difference of station or age, then
it is necessary only to ask the older or more
prominent person whether the introduction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><a href="images/86.png">[86]</a></span>
would be acceptable. This should be done
quietly, and quite out of hearing or knowledge
of the other person concerned.</p>

<p>A gentleman should ask a mutual friend for
an introduction to a lady whom he wishes to
meet. Unless there is no possible objection, the
mutual friend should not introduce the gentleman
until he has made sure that the lady is
willing.</p>

<p>It is not well to introduce gentlemen to one
another indiscriminately, nor should ladies be
so introduced. One wishes to keep the boundaries
of one's acquaintance within certain
definite limits, and choice is easier made before
acquaintance than after. So, one shows great
care in offering introductions to others, and
exercises the same care for one's self.</p>

<p>If a hostess and her guest are out walking
together, the hostess would introduce to her
guest every friend who happened to stop and
speak with her, and the guest, should she meet
acquaintances of her own, would introduce each
of them to her hostess. This is practically the
only case where indiscriminate introducing is
good form, and here the obligations of hospitality
safeguard it.</p>

<p>A lady usually offers her hand to a gentleman
who has been introduced to her, but a bow, a
smile, and a repetition of the name are all that
is necessary where several introductions are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><a href="images/87.png">[87]</a></span>
being made, as at a large reception or dancing
party.</p>

<p>A gentleman always offers his hand to another
gentleman on being introduced.</p>

<p>An elderly lady may offer her hand in all
introductions with perfect propriety.</p>

<p>If, while walking out with a friend, you meet
another, do not introduce the two. A transient
meeting is of no particular moment to them,
and their friendship or acquaintance with you
is not necessarily of strong enough interest to
make them desire acquaintance. If, however,
you meet at some public place, and are detained
there together for several minutes, then the introduction
should be given.</p>

<p>When meeting at the house of a mutual acquaintance,
friends may introduce friends, but
it is preferable to leave the introductions to the
hostess.</p>

<p>It is no longer necessary to introduce each
guest to everybody else at a party. Introductions
are made as opportunity or necessity may
dictate. This abolishing of promiscuous and
wholesale introductions relieves two very embarrassing
situations,&mdash;that of being introduced
by announcement to a whole roomful of
people, and that of being taken around and
introduced to them singly.</p>

<p>A mother may present her son, or a sister her
brother, or a wife her husband, if she so desires,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><a href="images/88.png">[88]</a></span>
without any question as to the propriety of it.
A man should not, on the other hand, introduce
another man to his wife, or a son or brother
make a presentation of a man to his mother or
sister, unless he knows that such acquaintance
could not but be agreeable to the lady, and unless
it meets with his own approval. For it is
a man's place always to safeguard a woman
against undesirable acquaintances.</p>

<p>A woman, in introducing her husband, gives
him his title, if he has one, as "Judge Hartwell,"
"Doctor Foley." The wife of the President
of the United States speaks of him only
as "The President," and in presenting people
to him, he is always addressed as "Mr. President,"
with the invariable omission of his surname.</p>

<p>A friend or acquaintance, no matter how distinguished,
is always presented to one's father
or mother or one's intimate relative, where the
intimacy of the relation makes an honor more
distinguishing, in the mind of the introducer,
than any of reputation or position.</p>

<p>A young man should be introduced to an
older man, a young woman to an older woman.</p>

<p>A man is always presented to a woman, never
the reverse.</p>

<p>If a lady is seated and a man is presented to
her, she need not rise. If two ladies, both
seated, are introduced to each other, they should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><a href="images/89.png">[89]</a></span>
rise, unless one is old or an invalid, in which
case both remain seated. Two gentlemen,
though both are seated, rise and shake hands
when introduced.</p>

<p>A young lady always rises when an elderly
person is introduced.</p>

<p>Introductions are not made at table. The
guests at a dinner party should be presented to
one another in the drawing-room before coming
to the table, and if that is impossible, as many
should be introduced as may be, especially those
who are to sit beside or near or opposite each
other. If one is seated beside a guest whom he
has not met, the man takes the initiative in
speaking a few words as soon as he takes his
seat, to which the lady responds always cordially,
keeping up more or less of a conversation
during the dinner.</p>

<p>At dancing parties all those who are giving
the party, as well as all the ushers and those
who receive, make introductions as general as
possible, so as to insure the pleasure of the
guests during the evening.</p>

<p>An introduction at a dance carries with it
the obligation on the part of the man to ask the
woman for a dance, and on her part to grant his
request unless her card is full.</p>

<p>When traveling great care should be taken
as to introductions.</p>

<p>As a guest one should be ready and willing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><a href="images/90.png">[90]</a></span>
to meet any one whom his host or hostess may
introduce, even though it be an enemy. The
obligations of hospitality rest nowhere more
heavily than in this matter. They demand that
impartial courtesy should be shown to every
one.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Calls</i></div>

<p>Calls must be made in person, rather than by
card left by messenger or post, after an invitation
to dinner, luncheon, supper, or similar
function, and that within a week or, at farthest,
two weeks of the date of the affair. One should
also call in person within two weeks of any entertainment
to which one has been asked, especially
if one has attended.</p>

<p>One need repay formal calls, where no invitation
to any social occasion has been received,
only once a year. Even in this case, cards may
be sent by mail. In the country it is usual to
go in person, though one does not ask if the lady
of the house is at home.</p>

<p>Calls should be made upon the "At Home"
day, if one is engraved upon the card. If a
person is ill, a near relative, or intimate friend,
may leave a card for her at the house of the
friend upon whom she wished to call.</p>

<p>Society holds young people who are free to
attend parties and entertainments under ste<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><a href="images/91.png">[91]</a></span>rn
obligation to pay their social calls. Young
mothers, professional women, students, invalids,
and semi-invalids are not expected to conform
rigidly to the same rules. If a young woman
can go to a party to amuse herself, she must call
afterwards to acknowledge the courtesy of the
invitation.</p>

<p>If a mother cannot call in person, her
daughter or some one else may pay the
necessary calls in her stead. Or she may invite
the people whom she would otherwise call
on, to an afternoon tea, which is more of a
compliment than a call.</p>

<p>In calling at a house, should the door be
opened by a member of the family, the caller
does not present her card to the lady or gentleman,
but steps in, asking for the person whom
she wants to see. She may leave her card unobtrusively
on the table when she goes out.</p>

<p>If a maid opens the door, the card is handed
to her and received on a small tray. No well-trained
maid ever extends her hand to receive
a visiting card.</p>

<p>If a caller wishes to be very formal, she
leaves a card for every lady in the family on
whom she wishes to call.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the season a wife always
leaves her husband's card with her own, and
she usually does this also when making a call
at the close of the season.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><a href="images/92.png">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>An unmarried woman calling on a married
friend leaves only one card. If the friend has
daughters or is entertaining a guest, a card may
be left for each.</p>

<p>A lady always rises to receive a visitor.</p>

<p>It takes good judgment to know when to go,
but it should be cultivated and practised.
Lingering in taking one's leave is a great weariness,
to one's hostess if not to one's self.</p>

<p>After a birth calls are made upon the mother
after the child is a month old.</p>

<p>After a death the friends of the family
should call in person inside of a month. The
members of the family do not receive them,
however, unless they wish to do so.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Social Calls of Men</i></div>

<p>A man never carries or leaves the cards of
other men, nor can he leave cards for any of
the women of his family.</p>

<p>A gentleman who calls on a lady's afternoon
at home leaves in the card tray, on entering the
house, a card for his hostess and one for his
host. The card for his host must be left, even
if that gentleman does not appear in the drawing-room,
provided the caller is acquainted with
him, and providing he is calling in acknowledgment
of some hospitality recently received.</p>

<p>If there is a host, hostess, and young lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><a href="images/93.png">[93]</a></span>
daughter in the house, and the caller is a friend
of the latter, he leaves three cards.</p>

<p>The man who is making his first or last call
for the season on the regular afternoon at home,
leaves one card for each of the ladies, and each
one of the men of the household whose acquaintance
he can claim.</p>

<p>When a man calls on a lady's day at home,
and his call has no reference to any social debts,
he leaves only one card in the tray. If he is
somewhat intimate in the house where the call
is paid, he leaves no card at all.</p>

<p>A man does not call upon a woman unless she
invites him, or some member of her family does,
or he goes with a mutual friend who has made
sure of his welcome. A woman may say to a
man, "Mother and I are usually at home Fridays,
and would like to have you call," or some
other form of invitation which denotes cordiality.</p>

<p>A man who desires to call in particular upon
one lady, in a family where there are several,
hands his card to the servant with the words,
"Please give this to Miss Curley, and I
would like to see all the other ladies also."
The ladies appear and greet him, withdrawing
that he may call upon the one he especially
wished to see.</p>

<p>If calling upon a guest in a home, you always
ask for the hostess also.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><a href="images/94.png">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>A man retains his hat, gloves, and walking
stick in hand during a formal call, though he
may have left his overcoat in the hall.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>First Calls</i></div>

<p>In America it is the usual custom for residents
of the city or town to call first upon newcomers.
Washington is a well-known exception
to this rule, as strangers there call first upon
government officials and their families. In
most European cities newcomers call first upon
those already in residence. The residents, from
the officials down, return their cards, and the
visitor or newcomer receives invitations to social
functions.</p>

<p>In practice the resident does not usually
know anything about the stranger, and may
not have even heard of her arrival. Sometimes
the newcomer sends out cards for several days
in a month, to those with whom she would like
to become acquainted. If she can enclose the
card of a mutual friend, as a silent voucher for
her social standing, her position is more quickly
and more surely granted her.</p>

<p>Clergymen and their families, brides, and
persons of note are entitled to receive first calls.
The older residents of the community are expected
to lead in the list of callers who welcome
the newcomers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><a href="images/95.png">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>First calls should be promptly returned,
within a week at the very latest.</p>

<p>A married woman making a first call upon a
married friend sends one of her own and two
of her husband's cards to her new acquaintance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>The Personal Card and the Engraved Invitation</h3>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Form of Card</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">A man's</span> card is usually one and a half by
three inches in size, and made of fairly stiff
bristol board. A woman's card is usually about
two and three-sixteenths by three inches, and
made of dull-finish, fine, medium-weight bristol
board.</p>

<p>The color of cards is a fine pearl white.
Cream or tinted cards are never in good form.</p>

<p>The engraving varies from plain script to
elaborate Old English text, or shaded Roman
type, according to the fashion. The engraver
may be trusted to know the style and stock most
in use.</p>

<p>The card of an unmarried lady should be
somewhat smaller than that of the married.
This distinction is made, however, only in case
of the card of the d&eacute;butante.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><a href="images/97.png">[97]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Inscription</i></div>

<p>If there is room across the card the full name
should be engraved. If the names are too long,
only the initials of given names should be used.</p>

<p>All inscriptions on one card should be in the
same style of type.</p>

<p>"Mr." is prefixed, unless there is a special
title, such as, "Reverend," "Doctor," "Colonel,"
etc. If a man should, in an emergency,
write his own name on a card, he would not
prefix the "Mr.," or any other title. The
name should be written in full and should be
an autograph.</p>

<p>A married lady should have her husband's
full name, or such form or parts of it as he
uses, with the title "Mrs.," and not her own
name.</p>

<p>A young woman has the title "Miss" engraved
before her name, even though she be
only a schoolgirl.</p>

<p>A young man has no title at all on his card,
but simply his full name.</p>

<p>The newly married couple use a card with
the title of "Mr. and Mrs." for the first year
after marriage, in returning their ceremonious
calls after the wedding, and paying formal calls
when the husband is unable to accompany the
wife. These cards should have the address in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><a href="images/98.png">[98]</a></span>
the lower right-hand corner, and the reception
day or days in the lower left. After the first
year they are seldom used in paying calls, but
can be used for condolence, congratulation, or
farewell where both husband and wife desire
to be formally represented.</p>

<p>A woman who is personally distinguished,
who occupies a high social position, or whose
husband stands at the head of his family, may
have only "Mrs. Barnaby," not "Mrs. John
Barnaby," upon her cards. It is better, however,
not to do so unless one has the indisputable
right to be considered as <i>the</i> Mrs. Barnaby of
the locality. It is customary for the wife of
the oldest brother of the oldest branch of the
family alone to have the privilege of this form.</p>

<p>The same rule of precedence applies to single
women. The oldest unmarried daughter of the
oldest brother, and she alone, has the right to
use "Miss Campbell" on her card, although
she may have a cousin who is much older than
herself, but who is the daughter of a younger
brother of the same family.</p>

<p>A widow has no cards during her year of
mourning, as she makes no formal visits. After
that, cards with black border to any depth desired
may be used.</p>

<p>A widow has no legal right to retain her
husband's Christian name, but she often prefers
to do so, and it is entirely proper, the question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><a href="images/99.png">[99]</a></span>
being one of sentiment alone. In case there is
a married son of the same name as the father,
then it is proper for the mother to put "Sr."
for Senior, at the end of her name, should she
desire still to retain her husband's Christian
name.</p>

<p>In such a case widows occasionally prefer to
use their own names or initials.</p>

<p>In this country a married woman merges her
name with that of her husband. It is not uncommon
nowadays for married women to sign
their own Christian name, their maiden surname,
and their husband's surname as their signature.
There is value in this as it preserves
the family identity of the married woman, but
the question of its legality may always be raised.</p>

<p>The name of daughter or daughters is often
engraved below that of the mother on her card,
before the young woman enters formally into
society. The form "The Misses Smith" may
be used, or the names given separately. In New
York in some circles the d&eacute;butante is not given
a separate card until she has been in society a
year. As American schoolgirls often have a
card with the prefix "Miss," the d&eacute;butante may
use this among her girl friends.</p>

<p>To write anything on an engraved card
except "Condolences," "Congratulations,"
"<i>P. p. c.</i>," is not considered good style, although
a lady may use her visiting card with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><a href="images/100.png">[100]</a></span>
"Five o'clock tea," "Music," or a special date
written upon it as an informal invitation to a
musical or "At Home."</p>

<p>A business or professional woman may have,
in addition to her society card, a card with her
own name for business purposes. This usually
has a word or two denoting her profession in
the lower left-hand corner, and her business address
in the lower right.</p>

<p>A lady's card should always contain her home
address in the lower right-hand corner. Her
afternoon "At Home" is usually given in the
lower left.</p>

<p>The address is often omitted from cards for
men, being engraved on those of the women of
the family. Men belonging to a fashionable
or well-known club put its name, instead of their
residence, on their cards. This is especially the
case when they do not live at home. If living at
a club, the address is put on the lower left-hand
corner; if living at home, the lower right-hand
corner.</p>

<p>On a man's business cards the title "Mr." is
omitted, the name of his firm, their business,
and address, being engraved in the lower left-hand
corner.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Titles</i></div>

<p>Titles which signify permanent rank, or profession
that lasts for life, and which are allied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><a href="images/101.png">[101]</a></span>
to a man's identity or distinctly bear upon his
social standing, should be used.</p>

<p>Temporary titles, which have no special social
rank or bearing, or professional titles, such as
"Esquire" for lawyers, which have no social
significance, are not used.</p>

<p>For the same reason that temporary or technical
titles are not used, honorary titles are
omitted. There should be no pretense in regard
to social position, as pretense is easy and futile.
A man appears in society simply as an ordinary
individual, to win favor and position by force
of his personality, or to lose it thereby.</p>

<p>An army or a naval officer, a physician, a
judge, or a clergyman may use his title on his
card, as, for instance, "Captain James Smith,"
"Judge Henry Gray," "Rev. Thomas Jones,
D. D." The card of an Associate Justice of the
United States Supreme Court at Washington
reads "Mr. Justice Holmes." Military or complimentary
titles are not used, nor are coats of
arms. In this republican country it is considered
an affectation and bad taste so to make use
of them. Political and judicial titles are also
omitted, as are academic titles, such as Chancellor,
Dean, and Professor.</p>

<p>No title below the rank of Captain is used on
the card in military circles. A lieutenant's card
would give his full name with the prefix "Mr."
and below it the words, "Lieutenant of Fifth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><a href="images/102.png">[102]</a></span>
Cavalry, United States Army," or simply,
"United States Coast Guard Service."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Use</i></div>

<p>The etiquette of the visiting card is a fluctuating
one. It cannot be laid down for all time,
or even for next season.</p>

<p>On entering at a reception, or afternoon tea,
one leaves a card in the salver offered by the
butler or attendant who opens the door, or upon
the hall table, as a reminder to the hostess, who
can hardly be expected to remember, if entertaining
a large number, every one who has been
there.</p>

<p>One does not leave cards at a wedding reception,
however.</p>

<p>At an afternoon tea, it is no longer necessary
to leave a card apiece from all the members of
the invited families to all the members of the
family of the hostess and her guests also. The
single card for the host and hostess is all that is
required.</p>

<p>Should one be invited to a series of receptions,
one leaves cards only once although one may
attend twice. Leaving cards in person after a
tea or reception is good form only for ceremonious
affairs. After the usual private reception
one should certainly call.</p>

<p>If only one member of a family can attend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><a href="images/103.png">[103]</a></span>
a reception to which the others have been invited,
she may leave the cards of the others, together
with her own, with perfect propriety.</p>

<p>Also when one is not able to attend a reception
or an afternoon tea, cards may be sent by
mail, although it is better to send them by messenger,
to arrive on the day of the entertainment.
One should call within a fortnight.</p>

<p>It is not now considered necessary to call in
person where formerly it was so held. The
sending of the personal card often takes the
place of the call. Nor need this be done by
messenger. Cards for any purpose may now be
sent by mail.</p>

<p>After removing from one part of the city to
another, it is customary for ladies to send engraved
cards with their new address and with
their reception day to all of their circle of acquaintances.</p>

<p>A woman who is stopping for a brief time in
a city where she has friends, sends to them her
card containing her temporary address and the
length of her stay, as "Here until June second,"
or "Here until Sunday."</p>

<p>A man, however, calls upon his friends, and
if they are absent leaves his card giving the
same information.</p>

<p>If a son old enough to go into society wishes
to do so, his card is left with his father's and
mother's at the beginning of the season. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><a href="images/104.png">[104]</a></span>
will then be invited to the functions given by
the friends of his parents.</p>

<p>When there is illness or mourning in the
household, friends leave their cards with the
words "To inquire," "Sincere condolence," or
"Sympathy" written upon them.</p>

<p>The card which accompanies wedding gifts
should be the joint card of "Mr. and Mrs.," if
the gift is sent jointly, and may well have the
words "Best wishes and congratulations,"
written upon it.</p>

<p>The initials "<i>P. p. c.</i>," meaning "<i>Pour
prendre cong&eacute;</i>," or "To take leave," are written
upon one's personal cards, which are then sent
out to one's friends when one is going away
from a place either permanently or for a long
time. They are usually written in the lower
left-hand corner of the card. These cards may
be sent by post, when the person leaving town
has not the time to make a personal visit. They
are not used when leaving town for the summer.</p>

<p>It is quite proper to send or leave "<i>P. p. c.</i>"
cards when one goes away from a summer resort,
especially if the people to whom they are
sent do not live during the year in the same
town or city with the sender.</p>

<p>It is no longer permissible to fold over the
ends of a card, to signify that it was intended
for all the members of the family.</p>

<p>The birth of a child may be announced by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><a href="images/105.png">[105]</a></span>
small card containing the full name of the child
daintily engraved, with the date of the birth
in the lower left-hand corner. The card is tied
to the mother's card by white ribbon, and both
are enclosed in one envelope and sent by post.</p>

<p>Visiting cards for those who are in mourning
are the same size as the ordinary card. The
width of the black border is regulated by the
degree of the relationship to the deceased.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Engraved Invitation</i></div>

<p>A fine grade of heavy, unglazed, pure white
paper, su&egrave;de finish, in double sheet folded to
a size about five by seven and a half inches,
or less, inserted in an envelope of the same
width but half the length, is used for the
billet on which wedding invitations and announcements
are engraved. The impress of the
plate demarks a margin of about an inch.</p>

<p>A heavy or medium grade of white bristol
board is used for invitations to "At Homes,"
dinner, receptions, dances, and all like social
functions for which the common visiting
card is not used. The size used varies
with the number of words in the invitation,
and may be quite large, as for a club or society
reception, or formal openings or special
occasions where a business corporation is the
host. These cards have the same plate margin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><a href="images/106.png">[106]</a></span>
as the wedding invitation, although it is much
narrower. Only the most formal invitations
have space left for the writing in of the name
of the guest.</p>

<p>The billet, however, has certain advantages,
especially where the occasion is very formal
and select, and the information which should
be furnished the guest is considerable. Elegance
of this sort is now very costly.</p>

<p>Several styles of type are in use: namely, the
script having close round letters, and being as
nearly black as Roman or Old English when
engraved; a script lighter and more cursive;
an Old English lettering; a shaded Roman
letter, which is constantly growing in popularity;
shaded Caxton; solid and shaded French
script; and a plain Roman block letter.</p>

<p>The script is the type most commonly used,
both because of its beauty and legibility, and
because of the comparative inexpensiveness of
engraving, the cost being about half of that of
either the Old English or the shaded Roman
type.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the size of page in this book
will not permit facsimile reproductions of
specimens of invitations and other social forms,
which in nearly every case require a different
proportion of space than the page offers.
Therefore, to reproduce the style of lettering
used for these forms has not been attempted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><a href="images/107.png">[107]</a></span>
The examples present correct wording and proportionate
arrangement.</p>

<p>The following plates, which are exact photographs
of steel and copper engraving, present
several styles of script, Old English, and shaded
and plain Roman faces, but do not represent
more than a few sizes, and those the most common.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><i>Dining and Party Inviations</i></div>

<p>The engraved card invitation for a luncheon
is usually worded as follows:</p>


<div class='center'><i>Mrs. Everetts S. Sinclair<br />
requests the pleasure of your company<br />
at Luncheon<br />
on Tuesday, February nineteenth<br />
at one o'clock<br />
Hotel Willard</i></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><a href="images/109.png">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>The dinner invitation is identical, except
that for "Luncheon" is substituted "Dinner,"
and the hour is usually half after seven or
eight o'clock. To this, or to any other dining
invitation, may be added in the lower left-hand
corner the words "Please reply," or, "The
favor of a reply is requested."</p>

<p>The party invitation may take either of the
two following forms:</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>Mrs. Harold Harmon Williams</i><br />
<i>requests the pleasure of your company</i><br />
<i>at a dancing party to be given</i><br />
<i>at the Glendale Country Club</i><br />
<i>Wednesday evening, December the twenty-ninth</i><br />
<i>from eight until eleven o'clock</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Fairfield Watson</i><br />
<i>request the pleasure of</i><br />
<br />
<i>company at The Somerset Club</i><br />
<i>on the evening of Friday the ninth of February</i><br />
<i>from nine until one o'clock</i><br />
<i>Dancing and Bridge</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <i>95 Jackson Boulevard</i><br />
</div>

<p>The blank invitation is very convenient, as
it may be sent out at short notice, and is definite
and personal. The following is a form which
lends itself to any one of the usual kinds of
home entertainment:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><a href="images/110.png">[110]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'>
<i>Mr. and Mrs. St. John Ambrose Lockwood<br />
request the pleasure of</i><br />

.............................................................................................<br />

<i>company at</i>...............................................................<br />

<i>on</i>...............................................................<br />

<i>at</i>.....................................................<br /></div>
<div class='right'><span style="margin-right: 8em;"><i>97 Washington Avenue</i></span><br />
</div>

<p>When, on an engraved invitation of any sort,
be it wedding or dinner or any other, a blank
line or lines are left for the insertion of the
name of the guest, there is danger that, unless
this is done with great care and by an able penman,
the beauty of the invitation be ruined,
and therefore its cost thrown away. For that
reason a wholly engraved invitation is perhaps
better, unless the work of addressing them and
inserting the name is to be done by a professional
penman. Of course, when this is done
and well done, there is a personal touch, a suggestion
of individual welcome, which can be
gained in no other way, and which the wholly
engraved invitation lacks.</p>

<p>When an entertainment is given by a family
at some place other than their home, the invitations
have the name of the place and the
street address put in at the usual place on the
invitation, and then in the lower right-hand
corner the words "Please reply," with the
home address.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><a href="images/111.png">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>A bachelor or widower uses his name alone
at the top of the invitation. He will, of course,
provide a chaperon, who in many respects
takes the place of a hostess and so acts, but her
name does not appear upon his invitation, unless
she be his sister or near relative. The invitation
then becomes a joint one, after the
usual form.</p>

<p>A widower with daughters may send out invitations
headed in either of the following
forms:</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>Mr. John Marquand</i><br />
<i>Miss Marquand</i><br />
<i>Miss Estelle Marquand</i><br />
</div>

<p>or</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>Mr. John Marquand</i><br />
<i>The Misses Marquand</i><br />
</div>

<p>For a dinner followed by a dance there are
two invitations, the one a dinner invitation at
an early hour for the favored few, the other a
dancing party invitation at a later hour.</p>

<p>Clubs have blanks which may be filled in by
their members when they wish to entertain.
These are issued in the club name, and are like
any other private invitation, except that at the
bottom and to the left "Compliments of" is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><a href="images/112.png">[112]</a></span>
engraved, and the name of the member who is
special host is written in.</p>

<p>Invitations containing the words "<i>Bal
Poudre</i>" signify that the entertainment is a
masquerade or fancy dress party, and the guests
are expected to come in fancy costume with
powdered hair.</p>

<p>The word "ball" is used of an elaborate
formal dance, usually a public one given by some
club or for charity, and rarely of a private dance.</p>

<p>In spite of the predominance of the engraved
invitation for the most formal affairs, still small
dinners, and even receptions and dancing
parties, are sometimes announced by the handwritten
invitations. The form should be the
same as the engraved one, although to very intimate
friends it should be changed to a friendly
note.</p>

<p>Acceptances are in the form of the invitation.
If that is an informal note, the acceptance or
regret is sent in the same style. If the invitation
is formal, the reply also should be written
in the third person and be about as follows:</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Allston B. Sinclair<br />
accept with pleasure the kind invitation of<br />
Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Emanuel Farrington<br />
for dinner<br />
on Thursday, the ninth of December<br />
at half after eight o'clock</i><br />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><a href="images/113.png">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>The reply to an invitation should be sent to
the person or persons who issued it, never to
any other member of the family, although such
a one may be better known.</p>

<p>To write the word "Regrets" on one's visiting
card and send it in declination of any invitation
is bad form, even if the invitation come
in similar shape. One should always write a
note of regret.</p>

<p>Bachelors and widowers, who entertain at
their apartments or studio or club, and army
and navy officers never use the words "At
Home," but always "request the pleasure (or
honour) of your presence."</p>

<p>If one is entertaining a guest and an invitation
is received, one may with propriety ask the
hostess for an invitation for one's guest, if the
form of entertainment is so general as to make
this right and reasonable; otherwise one must
decline the invitation. It would not be right to
ask for another dinner invitation, or one to a
select group of people, where the guest would
be an intruder.</p>

<p>It is preferable and a much later form to use
the words "Please reply," or "An early reply
is requested," rather than the abbreviation
"<i>R. s. v. p.</i>" for "<i>R&egrave;pondez, s'il vous pla&icirc;t</i>,"
meaning "Reply, if you please."</p>

<p>If a son should return from college or other
absence, and the parents wish to entertain for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><a href="images/114.png">[114]</a></span>
him, their invitations would have at the bottom
the word "For" followed by his name.</p>

<p>In sending out invitations, one should be
sent to the father and mother jointly, one to
each son separately, and one to the daughters
jointly, the latter being addressed "The Misses
Estabrook."</p>

<p>Invitations should be sent to people in mourning,
although they are not expected to accept.
They should not be slighted or forgotten during
such a period.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Wedding Invitations and Announcements</i></div>

<p>The following are the usual forms of wording
for the wedding invitation:</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Reinhard Ernst Ormond</i><br />
<i>request the honour of your presence</i><br />
<i>at the marriage of their daughter</i><br />
<i>Eida</i><br />
<i>to</i><br />
<i>Dr. Otto Bertelli</i><br />
<i>on Wednesday, the first of April</i><br />
<i>nineteen hundred and thirteen</i><br />
<i>at twelve o'clock</i><br />
<i>Church of the Messiah</i><br />
<i>St. Louis, Missouri</i><br /></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><a href="images/115.png">[115]</a></span></p>
<div class='center'><br />
<i>Mr. Arnold Hamilton Forsyth</i><br />
<i>requests the pleasure of your company</i><br />
<i>at the marriage reception of his daughter</i><br />
<i>Margaret</i><br />
<i>and</i><br />
<i>Mr. Walter Mallory</i><br />
<i>on the evening of Wednesday, the twenty-ninth</i><br />
<i>of June</i><br />
<i>one thousand nine hundred and twelve</i><br />
<i>from eight until ten o'clock</i><br />
<i>17 Elm Hill Avenue</i><br />
<i>Philadelphia, Pennsylvanis</i><br />
<i>R. s. v. p.</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<i>Dr. and Mrs. Maurice Howe Cavanaugh</i><br />
<i>request the honour of</i><br />

<i>Rebecca Falmouth</i><br />
<i>to</i><br />
<i>Mr. Charles Hunnewell Clark</i><br />
<i>on Monday, the ninth of July</i><br />
<i>at eight o'clock</i><br />
<i>Church of the Redeemer</i><br />
<i>Washington</i><br />
</div>

<p>The usual form of marriage announcement is as
follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><a href="images/116.png">[116]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'>
<i>Mr. and Mrs. William T. Kimball</i><br />
<i>announce the marriage of their daughter</i><br />
<i>Dorothy Lucinda</i><br />
<i>to</i><br />
<i>Mr. LeRoy L. Hallock</i><br />
<i>on Wednesday, the first day of December</i><br />
<i>one thousand nine hundred and twelve</i><br />
<i>Chicago, Illinois</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<i>Mr. Arthur Edmand Sawyer</i><br />
<i>and</i><br />
<i>Miss Emma Pauline Farrington</i><br />
<i>announce their marriage</i><br />
<i>on Sunday the sixteenth of July</i><br />
<i>one thousand nine hundred and ten</i><br />
<i>at Boston, Massachusetts</i><br />
</div>

<p>The "At Home" card of the bridal couple,
which goes with a wedding invitation, does not
have the name of the couple upon it, but reads
simply</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>At Home</i><br />
<i>after the first of November</i><br />
<i>1219 Pennsylvanis Avenue</i><br />
<i>Washington</i><br />
</div>

<p>When an "At Home" card is included in a
wedding <i>announcement</i>, however, the name of
the couple appears upon it, as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><a href="images/117.png">[117]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'>
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Albion Frederick Marston</i><br />
<br />
<i>Will be at home</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <i>763 Chapel Avenue</i><br />
<i>after the first of August</i>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <i>Toronto</i><br />
</div>

<p>For the card of invitation to the wedding
reception the wording is as follows:</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>Reception</i><br />
<i>immediately after the ceremony</i><br />
<i>Eight Salem Street</i><br />
</div>

<p>or</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>Reception</i><br />
<i>immediately after the ceremony</i><br />
<i>in the church parlors</i><br />
</div>

<p>In the case of a church wedding, it is always
well to enclose with the invitation a small card
reading: "Please present this card at the
church on August the third."</p>

<p>In case the wedding takes place in the country
and invitations are sent to many friends in
the city, a card giving directions as to what
train to take, and where, which is to be presented
to the conductor instead of a ticket, and
which entitles the possessor to special accommodations,
is enclosed with the invitation.</p>

<p>Wedding invitations, or announcements, and
their accompanying cards, are enclosed in two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><a href="images/118.png">[118]</a></span>
envelopes, one within the other, of the same
stock as the billets. Upon the outer is written
the name of the person and his street address;
upon the inner only the name of the one for
whom it is intended.</p>

<p>Wedding invitations should be addressed to
"Mrs. Chandler Jones," on the outside envelope.
Within this is a second envelope addressed
to "Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Jones."
The older custom is to address the outside envelope
to "Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Jones," as
well as the inside. The lady of the house is
now, however, beginning to be looked upon as
head of its social affairs, as her husband is of
its business affairs, and hence the style of addressing
invitations to her.</p>

<p>The words "And Family" are no longer
used after the parents' names, but separate invitations
are sent to the members.</p>

<p>It is quite the courteous thing to include
among the people invited to a wedding, especially
if it is to be in a church, the special business
friends and associates of the bridegroom-elect,
his father, and the bride's father.</p>

<p>In case the invitations are for the ceremony
only at a church wedding, the address of the
bride's parents should be embossed upon the
outside envelope.</p>

<p>Acquaintances purely professional do not
receive cards to a wedding. One's physician,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><a href="images/119.png">[119]</a></span>
however, if his family is prominent socially,
may be included among the guests.</p>

<p>Announcement cards should be quite ready
to post immediately after the ceremony. They
should be sent to all the circle of friends and
acquaintances of both the bride's and the bridegroom's
families, save to those who have been
invited to the marriage or the wedding reception.</p>

<p>The announcement of an "At Home" or
reception should always be made on a separate
card,&mdash;not on a corner of the wedding invitation
or announcement.</p>

<p>An immediate reply is necessary when one is
invited to a home wedding. If the wedding
is a church wedding, and there is no reception
following it, one makes no reply if one intends
to be present, but sends one's card upon the
date set, if one cannot attend.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Various Announcement Cards</i></div>

<p>In case of the postponement of a wedding or
a dinner or reception because of some grave
accident or illness, the cancellation of the invitations,
or the announcement of the postponement,
should be engraved and sent out at
the earliest possible date.</p>

<p>For a wedding it may read somewhat as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><a href="images/120.png">[120]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'>
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Maynard S. Taylor</i><br />
<i>regret to announce</i><br />
<i>that on account of serious illness in the family</i><br />
<i>the marriage of their daughter</i><br />
<i>Emmeline and Mr. Fosdick Arlington</i><br />
<i>will be indefinitely postponed</i><br />
</div>

<p>A family which has passed through a period
of calamity and bereavement may wish to make
some acknowledgment of the attentions of
friends, and may do so in some such form as
follows:</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>The brothers and sisters of</i><br />
<i>Dr. Ralph J. Harkins</i><br />
<i>gratefully acknowledge</i><br />
<i>your kind expression of sympathy</i><br />
</div>

<p>The special "At Home" card which is used
for a reception in honor of a friend or guest
may contain the name of the friend either on
the first or the last line of the invitation, with
the words "To meet" before it; as:</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>Mrs. Ernest L. Lafricain<br />
At Home<br />
Thursday, December twenty-third<br />
from four to six<br />
275 Grand Pr&eacute; Avenue, Montreal<br />
To meet Mrs. Jackson Seymour Montgomery</i></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><a href="images/121.png">[121]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>For a general reception the following form
is good:</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Henry Illington Bray</i><br />
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Harold Bray</i><br />
<i>request the honor of your presence</i><br />
<i>on New Year's Day</i><br />
<i>from four until half after seven o'clock</i><br />
<i>174 Albemarle Street</i><br />
<i>Winnipeg</i><br />
</div>

<p>The private engraved card for Christmas and
New Year greetings, which may be sent to one's
entire list of friends, is much in favor. Great
distinction and individuality of design and
selection of sentiment may be obtained by this
means. The following is an appropriate form:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">"<i>The glory breaks</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 8em;"><i>And Christmas comes once more</i>"</span><br /></div>
</div><div class='center'><br />
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Nathaniel Clarke Sutherland</i><br />
<i>cordially greet</i><br />
<br />
<i>with every good wish of the Season</i><br />

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>BEHAVIOR IN PUBLIC</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> test of the depth of one's courtesy is
found in one's attitude to strangers and the
public at large. If one observes toward them
the little courtesies, then one may be safely
trusted to keep to the highest ideal of social
intercourse in times of emergency and rigid
testing.</p>

<p>Always in a public place the real gentleman
and lady will be unobtrusive, speaking quietly,
and showing in their manner that they each
believe himself and herself but a single unit
in the world of humanity, and therefore not entitled
to monopolize attention. They will go
about their business with none of that idle curiosity
which forms the street crowd.</p>

<p>In places of public amusement, they will
show true courtesy by not coming in late,&mdash;that
is, by being on time or missing the performance.
They will not rustle their programs
needlessly. They will so dispose of their coats
and wraps that others will not be inconvenienced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><a href="images/123.png">[123]</a></span>
by them, even if it takes them an extra
ten minutes at the close of the evening to obtain
them from the cloak room.</p>

<p>They will not talk or whisper to each other
during speaking or singing on the stage, or at
any time when so doing will make it difficult
for others to hear what is going on. They will
applaud temperately, and with only that degree
of fervor which is for the best interests of the
audience and the actors as a whole. That is,
at a concert they will not so applaud one artist
as to break up the program.</p>

<p>At formal business meetings they will take
pains to conform to Parliamentary usage, which
is really only the etiquette of debate, and will
not insist upon rights which have been ruled
out, or in word or manner express a disorderly
spirit. "The greatest good of the largest number"
will be the rule of their deportment in
public.</p>

<p>At a social occasion of any sort, every one
present is under obligation to do what he can
to add to the general pleasure. If he cannot or
will not, he should remain away. If he is asked
to play a musical instrument or sing, he should
do so without urging, for his talents, except in
very special cases wherein he would not be
asked, are or should be at the disposal of the
company, or at the request of his hostess. Any
voluntary or requested performance of this sort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><a href="images/124.png">[124]</a></span>
may be as brief as he pleases, and should be
brief, unless his talent is so great that there
can be no possible doubt of its acceptability, and
he is in a generous mood,&mdash;a combination of
circumstances rare in any but the most talented
circles.</p>

<p>If you turn the pages of music for a musician,
do so in a quiet and self-forgetful manner.
Interest in you is quite subordinate to interest
in the performer.</p>

<p>Do not by extravagant applause encourage
parlor recitations, for mediocre talent is always
profuse.</p>

<p>It is a mark of good breeding to control or
at least conceal one's moods, so that in company
one always appears to be content, if not happy.
It adds much to the happiness of others to
give this impression, and is therefore generous
as well as wise.</p>

<p>It is always rude to interrupt with conversation,
or yawning, or any motion, a musical performance,
or any entertainment whether public
or private, in which those about one are interested.
One should retire if he cannot refrain.</p>

<p>Behavior in church may be taught in one
great principle, providing that principle is
fundamental enough. The sense of reverence
for the things of the spiritual life may be felt,
if not comprehended, by even the child. No
amount of "Don't's," if the spirit of worship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><a href="images/125.png">[125]</a></span>
be not instilled, will avail to make the child of
any age an attentive and reverent worshiper
or even attendant at church.</p>

<p>The sense of worship will forbid whispering
and chatting with friends, the noisy turning
of the leaves of hymn-book or Bible, or an
indifferent or scornful attitude when any are in
prayer.</p>

<p>Another sign of the same reverence is the
careful observance of punctuality at the service.
A church service is, by its very nature, a more
intimate and important service to the attendant
than any other. Therefore, to come in late,
thus distracting the attention of those who have
gone to church for meditation or worship, is a
far more flagrant offense against the rights
of others, than is the disturbing of their pleasure
at a theatre or a concert by a tardy entrance.</p>

<p>The habit of a vacant or absent mind in company
is a grave fault, and works greatly to the
detriment of one's reputation for intelligence,
in spite of all else that one may do to establish
it.</p>

<p>Straightforward attentiveness is the attitude
of most profit and enjoyment in society. One
learns then what other people are thinking
about, and becomes more and more active mentally.
Such an attitude establishes the confidence
of others in one's sincerity and intelligence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><a href="images/126.png">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Inquisitiveness is fatal to real charm. No
one cares to talk twice with a person who, no
matter what his wit or ability to entertain, has
betrayed one into divulging facts or making
remarks which he regrets.</p>

<p>Upon the street a gentleman always takes the
outside of the walk, when with a lady, the custom
having come down from the days when
dangers beset the path, and the man had to be
at the point of vantage for the protection of the
woman.</p>

<p>When a married woman and an unmarried
girl are walking together, the married woman
takes the outside of the walk.</p>

<p>In passing single file other people or some
obstacle, the gentleman always steps back and
allows the lady to precede him. If, however,
the way is crowded or there is necessity that
she should be protected, he goes first.</p>

<p>In entering a hotel dining-room the lady always
goes first.</p>

<p>A lady never takes a gentleman's arm unless
she is blind, infirm, or crippled, or in a turbulent
crowd.</p>

<p>The considerate person will not enter even
a public hotel late at night, much less a home,
his own or any other, in a noisy, careless
fashion. Those who are asleep deserve as great
consideration as if they were awake, and more
also.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><a href="images/127.png">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The modern courtesy of letting each one pay
for himself in a car, a train, a restaurant, or a
theatre, is a much more rational one than the
older form of permitting one to act as host, as
if he were in his own house. A gentleman
might offer to pay for others, if he wished to,
but he should not insist upon paying; nor
should any one carelessly or designedly permit
his expenses to be paid by another, unless he
himself expects to offer equal hospitality at another
time.</p>

<p>In entering a carriage or automobile, one
should step promptly, without either loitering
or haste. If one is to sit facing the horses or
the front of the automobile, and there is but one
step to take, one puts the left foot on it. If
there are two steps, the right foot should take
the first, the left the second. If one is to face
in the opposite direction from what the vehicle
is going, one should use the right foot first in
case of the one step, and the left foot first in
case of the two.</p>

<p>When two ladies who are guest and hostess
are driving together, the guest should enter first,
taking the farther seat, facing the front of the
carriage, so that it will not be necessary for her
hostess to pass her. When a mother and
daughter enter a carriage, the mother precedes,
and the daughter sits by her side if no other
lady is present. In case of two daughters, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><a href="images/128.png">[128]</a></span>
elder sits by the side of the mother, and the
younger sits opposite.</p>

<p>The fashionable hours for driving are from
two-thirty to five in the winter, and from three
to six-thirty in the summer.</p>

<p>Young women never ride horseback in cities
or in public parks without an escort. In the
country the rule is not so rigidly enforced. In
case a groom is the escort, he rides slightly behind,
keeping watch that he may be of service.</p>

<p>A riding-habit should be absolutely neat,
simple, and inconspicuous. The hat should be
plain, the hair compactly done, and the whole
effect of the costume trim serviceableness and
grace, rather than prettiness.</p>

<p>In mounting a horse a woman gathers up her
habit in her left hand, and stands close to the
horse with her right hand on the pommel of the
saddle. The man who assists her stoops and
places his right hand with the palm up at a convenient
distance from the ground. The lady
then puts her left foot into his hand, and
springs up into the saddle with his assistance.</p>

<p>It is necessary, first, to have a firm seat;
secondly, a skillful hand on the rein. One
should sit in the middle of the saddle, in an
easy, natural position, with the body not stiff
but supple and responsive to the motion of the
horse. The elbows should be well in to the side,
in a line with the shoulders, and the hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><a href="images/129.png">[129]</a></span>
should be relaxed and yet responsive to the
slightest pull of the rein.</p>

<p>It is no longer considered wise and necessary
for a woman to use a side saddle. In the freedom
of a graceful divided skirt, she strides the
saddle as do the men, and therefore has an equal
chance with them to ride gracefully and safely,&mdash;a
privilege which fashion long denied.</p>

<p>To keep to the right always is the only safe
rule in the United States. In England and
Canada the rule of keeping to the left is observed
with the same rigidity.</p>

<p>In business life it is not good form to dine
with your employer. This does not include a
ban upon those business dinners, where there
is a group of people, the majority of them men,
with one or two unmarried business women of
equal or superior business standing, who meet
over the dinner table to talk of business problems.
That occasion has its own etiquette, and
one which the business man or woman readily
fashions for himself or herself, and which follows
the rules of business expediency rather
than social life.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to recognize in society a
strictly business acquaintance unless you wish
to do so.</p>

<p>Neatness demands that the traveler always
carry his own toilet articles, and not depend
upon the public supplies, which are, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><a href="images/130.png">[130]</a></span>
supposedly safe and sanitary for use in emergencies.</p>

<p>The dress for traveling should be plain and
simple, suited to the need rather than elaborate.
The effect of crumpled finery is so very unpleasant
that no person of taste will make a
display of it in a public conveyance.</p>

<p>If you wish to leave your seat in a train, a
coat or bag placed upon it is sufficient to reserve
it for you. The removal of a coat or bag so
placed is a very great rudeness.</p>

<p>A gentleman will give up his seat to two
ladies, or to a gentleman and lady traveling together,
as he can be more readily accommodated
in the single seats than can they.</p>

<p>It is courteous for a gentleman who has a
vacant place in the seat with him to offer it to
a lady who is standing, and so prevent her from
feeling that she is intruding in taking it, if
there are no other seats vacant.</p>

<p>When a man opens a door for a woman who
is a stranger, or offers her any other civility, or
begs pardon for some blunder, he takes off his
hat to her.</p>

<p>While traveling alone, it is not necessary or
wise to be resentful of polite remarks or attentions.
They should be met with equal politeness.
Quiet dignity and tact will terminate
without offense any conversation which has
grown too familiar or tedious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><a href="images/131.png">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>The comfort of all in the car, not of one individual,
should be consulted in the opening of
windows and doors, and the consent of those
sitting near should be gained.</p>

<p>It is a grave breach of good manners to
monopolize a dressing-room for quite a period
of time. One should be as expeditious as possible,
and should not seriously inconvenience
others, even if he deprives himself of some of
the comfort he desires.</p>

<p>It is not well to travel unless you can afford
it. If you can and do travel, deal courteously
and generously with those who serve you.</p>

<p>Ask questions only of officials of the road or
the ship, or of policemen in the street.</p>

<p>The exchange of visiting cards with strangers,
unless under unusual circumstances, is unwise
and bad form.</p>

<p>Ordinarily a lady pays her fare herself, unless
she is under escort of a relative or intimate
friend to whom she gives the right to pay for
her. When she enters a car alone and there
meets an acquaintance, she always pays her own
fare, unless the acquaintance may be an old
and intimate friend.</p>

<p>When a lady is taking a long trip under escort
of some gentleman friend, it is proper for her
to reimburse him for his expenditures in her
behalf. She should hand him her purse with
which to purchase her ticket.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><a href="images/132.png">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>The munching of nuts, fruit, or candy in a
crowded public conveyance is a serious offense
against those about you. A neat lunch, quietly
eaten at an appropriate hour, is not offensive
and is quite permissible. But one should not
impose even the odor of food upon people who
are forced to be near, and who may find it extremely
disagreeable.</p>

<p>The recent passage and enforcement of laws
regarding expectoration in public places is a
great step in advance, and must be rigidly maintained
for the sake of the public health. The
chewing of gum, while no menace to society, is
as unesthetic and disgusting as expectoration,
and should fall under as righteous if not as
severe a ban.</p>

<p>In a car or train do not fan yourself so
vigorously that the person in front of you feels
the air current upon the back of his neck. A
book or newspaper should not be placed so that
it rubs constantly against the hat of the person
in the seat in front.</p>

<p>Pushing, shoving, and all like methods of
getting people to move out of your way, or of
getting ahead of others, are marks of great rudeness,
and have a tendency to retard rather than
aid one's progress through a crowd or into a
car. The quiet, good-natured crowd disperses
most rapidly.</p>

<p>At the ferry and all prepayment places, have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><a href="images/133.png">[133]</a></span>
the right change in hand, so that you do not
keep back those who are in a rush to catch a
boat or a car, by fumbling for your money or
making the receiver make change.</p>

<p>Do not carry an umbrella carelessly. You
are as culpable if you injure another as another
would be if he injured you.</p>

<p>To converse in loud tones or talk of personal
matters anywhere in public shows great lack of
fine feeling and good breeding.</p>

<p>Never show hostility, nor permit people to
quarrel with you. The irritability which
crowded conditions aggravate makes it necessary
to adhere, from principle, to the rule of strict
good-will toward all.</p>

<p>If you are escorting a woman, do not permit
her to suffer any discomfort; but if, by chance,
she does, do not pick a quarrel with the person
who caused it. Firmly but quietly afford her
protection, but do not demand satisfaction for
discomforts or insults for which there is no
satisfaction and whose discussion only increases
the offense.</p>

<p>A lady need feel no embarrassment if she is
obliged to spend a few days in a hotel alone.
Upon entering she would go to the desk and
make arrangements for a room. When the
choice is made she surrenders her hand bag to
the bell-boy, who conducts her to her room. She
should, for her own convenience and protection,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><a href="images/134.png">[134]</a></span>
deposit valuables or large sums of money with
the hotel proprietor in the office safe. Then the
responsibility becomes his, but he does not assume
it if they are left in the room. Upon leaving
her room, she should lock her trunks and
door, and leave the key with the clerk at the
desk.</p>

<p>A lady's deportment in a hotel is that of
quiet reserve, but not of haughty distance. She
should dress simply and plainly, so as not to
attract attention, as she is in a public place.
The only time when elegant dress is permissible
at a hotel is when one is with an escort, or is
one of a group of people so dressed in order to
attend some function.</p>

<p>A lady will not stand or linger in the halls
of a hotel, will not loiter about the hotel office,
or walk out alone upon the piazza or any conspicuous
place, or stand at the windows of
the parlor. She will remember that she is in
a public place, where she may encounter all
classes of people, so she will not permit herself
any of the liberties of a home. She will not go
through the halls humming or singing, or take
a book or newspaper from the public parlor and
carry it off to her room, even if she does shortly
return it. She will not, even in her own room,
make such noise as will attract attention or disturb
other guests.</p>

<p>She will not call a cab herself, but will summon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><a href="images/135.png">[135]</a></span>
a bell-boy and have him attend to it. After
her baggage is packed she will let the servants
attend to it, even to the handing her of her umbrella
and hand bag after she is in the carriage.
She will never take the liberty of chiding a
servant, but will make a necessary complaint to
the clerk at the desk.</p>

<p>To open a window in the parlor of a hotel,
when others are by and may be discomforted,
is a breach of politeness. Also it is not right
that even an accomplished musician or singer
should use the piano of the hotel parlor, if
others are in the room, unless he has received
a unanimous invitation to do so.</p>

<p>One may greet fellow guests in the parlor or
the dining-room without being thought forward
or intrusive, and also may respond to such
greetings without compromise, as such acquaintance
does not imply or demand recognition
elsewhere.</p>

<p>A lady, when alone at a hotel dining table,
will decide quickly what dishes she wishes, and
order them distinctly but quietly. She will
wait patiently to be served, without any display
of embarrassment. It is allowable to read a
newspaper while waiting for breakfast, but not
good taste to bring books to the table at any
time. If she desires a dish which she sees,
but the name of which she does not know,
she will not point to it, but will indicate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><a href="images/136.png">[136]</a></span>
it to the waiter by her glance and her description.</p>

<p>If she has friends or makes table acquaintances,
she will talk with them in a low tone.
She will never talk with some one at another
table, nor laugh loudly. If any civility, such
as the passing of food, is offered her by either
a lady or a gentleman, she will express her
thanks, but will not start a conversation.</p>

<p>The usual good manners of cultivated people,
emphasized by the additional restraint which
the presence of the public imposes, is a safe
standard of etiquette in a hotel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><a href="images/137.png">[137]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE ART OF BEING A GUEST</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Just</span> as the host and hostess, in sending out
an invitation, obligate themselves to make
everything as enjoyable as possible for their
guest, so a guest, in accepting, obligates himself
or herself to meet the efforts of the host and
hostess at least halfway. Success in the art of
being a guest depends more upon the spirit in
which one accepts of entertainment than upon
the entertainment offered.</p>

<p>A formal dinner is one of the most solemn
obligations of society. After having once accepted
the invitation, only death or mortal illness
is an excuse for not attending.</p>

<p>One may attend a formal reception and not
expend more than twenty minutes of time, if
one wishes to be very prompt. The round of
social duty there is brief. A lady removes her
wrap, but not her hat or gloves, in the dressing-room,
and thence goes directly to the drawing-room.
The guest here greets the host and
hostess, briefly if the reception is large and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><a href="images/138.png">[138]</a></span>
flow of incoming guests constant, then passes to
the room where the refreshments are served.
After partaking of these, the guest may leave
without bidding adieu to the hostess, unless the
reception is small and she is free to speak a
second time with her guests.</p>

<p>If one is present at an afternoon tea or reception,
it is not always necessary to call afterwards;
yet, many hostesses expect such a call
if the affair has been formal. One should certainly
call after a tea given to introduce a
d&eacute;butante, or a wedding reception, or one given
in honor of some special person or event.</p>

<p>If a guest is not pleased with the food provided
at a luncheon or dinner, or for any
special reason cannot eat of any one dish, he
should try and satisfy himself with something
else, and make no comment upon it, doing his
utmost to prevent his hostess from thinking
that she has not well provided for him.</p>

<p>At a dancing party a young man should assist
his hostess in seeing that all the young ladies
have an equal chance to dance, and that none
are obliged to sit out dances because of a dearth
of partners. His obligation to his hostess and
to society should be thus honored, as it is not,
of course, a private affair for his own amusement,
and as upon him, more than upon the
young women, depends its success.</p>

<p>It is necessary that introductions be freely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><a href="images/139.png">[139]</a></span>
made at a dancing party, in order that all may
enjoy the evening, and every one should try to
make all his friends acquainted with each other.</p>

<p>A young woman remains seated by the side
of her chaperon until asked to dance. After a
dance her partner returns with her to the
chaperon.</p>

<p>If the son of the hostess requests a dance of
a young woman, she should give it unless her
program is quite full. If for any reason she
refuses a dance to one man, she should not
give it to another, but should sit it out. A
woman, having once promised a dance, should
fulfill her promise unless too ill to do so, in
which case she will dance no more during the
evening. The young man who is thus refused
is free, having returned with her to her
chaperon, to seek another partner.</p>

<p>Unless a young couple are engaged to each
other, they should not dance together so often
as to be conspicuous. Nor may they disappear
into secluded corners and sit out dances. It is
poor taste and very questionable etiquette, even
if engaged.</p>

<p>When asked to dance, a woman hands the
man her program, saying, "I am not engaged
for that dance, and will be pleased to give it to
you." After the dance the man may thank the
woman for it, and she may make some remark
to express her pleasure in it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><a href="images/140.png">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>If a man is delayed in claiming a woman for
the promised dance, he should make profuse
apologies.</p>

<p>A man dances first with the woman he escorts,
or with the daughters of the hostess, or
her guests in the house. Afterward he may
choose for himself, always remembering that
he should assist his hostess in giving a good
time to all.</p>

<p>A woman always makes the first move toward
going home at every social gathering. At a
dance it is not necessary to say good-night to
the hostess unless there is a good opportunity.</p>

<p>If a man is suddenly called away, he should
try to find partners for the ladies with whom
he engaged dances, and should explain his leaving
to them.</p>

<p>It is not obligatory, but simply a pleasant
custom, for a man to send flowers to the young
woman whom he is going to escort to a dancing
party. When she is his fianc&eacute;e, it is especially
appropriate and appreciated.</p>

<p>When one is on a visit, or at a house or weekend
party, one has to follow the style of dress
of the people whom one is visiting, so no hard
and fast rules can be laid down. One should
have suitable garments for each of the forms of
recreation which one is to enjoy, and should follow
quite closely the requirements of the hour.</p>

<p>When traveling, small, plain hats and tidily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><a href="images/141.png">[141]</a></span>
draped veils are necessary. For mountain
visits, thicker clothing and heavier wraps will
be in demand, than are used in the city. When
it is the custom to dress for dinner, one should
always adhere to it, and so plan one's hours
that nothing interferes with so doing and being
prompt as well.</p>

<p>A guest should not claim the entire time of
her hostess. The hours between breakfast and
lunch belong to the hostess for the doing of her
household and family duties, and the guest
should entertain herself during them.</p>

<p>No guest should ever accept an invitation to
an entertainment, a drive, or any other amusement
without first consulting with her hostess.
If, having friends in the same city or town, she
has invitations from them for special occasions,
she should inform her hostess of them promptly,
that two plans may not be made for the same
date.</p>

<p>Unless a guest is ill or very old and feeble,
she never suggests retiring. That is the duty
of the hostess.</p>

<p>A guest should take pains to arrive when expected.
If she has promised a visit, she should
keep her promise, unless matters of serious illness
or grave moment forbid it, in which case
a prompt and explanatory apology is imperative.</p>

<p>The guest should decide with her hostess,
early in her stay, upon the date of her departure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><a href="images/142.png">[142]</a></span>
if that has not been already settled in
the form of the invitation, and should then
abide rigidly by it, allowing nothing but the
most earnest importunity on the part of her
hostess personally, and for clearly shown and
newly arising reasons, to detain her longer.</p>

<p>The guest should be pleased and well entertained
with everything that is done for her
amusement, or should appear to be so. If she
cannot give herself up to the enjoyment of the
sort of entertainment which her host and hostess
provide, she should not accept the invitation to
visit them.</p>

<p>The guest should be punctual at meals and
conform in every particular to the ways of the
household. She should not arrive in the living-room
or drawing-room at hours when there will
be none to entertain her, and when it would
embarrass her hostess to know that she was unattended.
To sit up after the family has gone
to bed, to lie in bed after the entire family have
risen, to be late at meals, to be writing an important
letter or doing some mending when the
carriage is at the door for a drive, or wish to
go to drive when the carriage has been dismissed,
to be too tired to attend the dinner or
reception given in one's honor, to fail to keep
appointments for the stroll or some sport because
one wants to do something else,&mdash;these
things show a total lack of consideration on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><a href="images/143.png">[143]</a></span>
part of the guest, and make it impossible to enjoy
her stay or wish for her return.</p>

<p>At times which seem appropriate it is well
to retire to one's room and leave the family by
themselves. It is not necessary for the family
life and comfort to be sacrificed constantly to
the guest. Hospitality would be more generously
shown if it did not make so many unnecessary
demands upon the time and comfort of the
members of the family.</p>

<p>The guest should never take sides in any
family discussion, and if anything unpleasant
occurs, she should ignore it entirely, and not
seem to know anything about it or take any
interest in it.</p>

<p>It is an unpardonable breach of loyalty to
one's hosts to retail any information one may
have acquired on a visit, or discuss their characteristics
and management with any one.</p>

<p>A guest need not attend religious services,
or be present at the calls of commonplace people,
or enter into local philanthropies, unless he
wishes to do so. True hospitality relieves him
from all sense of obligation in these matters.
If, however, carriages are provided so that
guests may attend church, or guests are told
of the hour for family worship and are invited
to be present, it is more courteous to attend.</p>

<p>Guests at country houses should be willing
to take hold and help in any emergency, such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><a href="images/144.png">[144]</a></span>
as the absence or sickness of the servants, and
should be willing to join heartily in the country
frolics where work is usually to be shared by all.</p>

<p>In the country people visit in large parties,
so when one is invited to go on an excursion or
with a crowd to visit some neighbor, one should
not hesitate for fear of being one too many.</p>

<p>One should follow the wish of the host or
hostess in regard to giving the servants some
gratuity for service rendered, if that wish is
known; otherwise, unless there is an accepted
rule to the contrary, it is well to give, when
leaving, a small gift of money to such of the
servants as have been especially helpful. One
should always treat servants with consideration
and kindness, if not with generosity. It is better
to be less lavish with money and more painstaking
in remembering personally the people
who have served you, renewing acquaintance
with them if opportunity offers, treating them
in a human way, and not with the indifference
with which you would treat a mechanism.</p>

<p>If a gift is given, it should be done unostentatiously.
The tactful, quiet way of doing it,
free from patronage, and showing only good-will
and gratitude for service rendered, is the
only polite way. Money never compensates
for haughtiness and brusqueness, and the gentleman
or lady in spirit will not be unmindful of
the feelings of even an incompetent servant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><a href="images/145.png">[145]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE DUTIES OF HOST AND HOSTESS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Hospitality</span> is a great pleasure to people
of a sociable nature, and its obligations have a
most refining influence. The generous consideration
of others reaches its acme when one is
constantly entertaining little circles of friends,
with no thought but to give happiness.</p>

<p>The pleasant custom of serving tea each day
at five o'clock is one which admits of great enjoyment.
The man of the house tries to be at
home for the quiet social hour before the family
dinner. The young people of the family are
gathering after the day's dispersion. The
friends, who are out calling or on their way
home, drop in for a pleasant chat; and the
charming hostess has time for many glimpses
of friends, and chance also to say the right
word to some friend in need of cheer, who knew
that she could be found at her daily hour of
welcome.</p>

<p>The custom of receiving on a certain day of
the week is a sensible and hospitable one. If
one has such an "At Home" day, it is more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><a href="images/146.png">[146]</a></span>
polite for friends to call on that day than on
any other. If a lady has, however, sent out
cards announcing that she is "At Home" on
"Wednesdays in January and February," one
should not call on those days unless one has received
the card having the special invitation.</p>

<p>Some receive once a month during the season.
They have the day engraved on their card, as
"The first Friday until Lent," or "The second
Wednesday until April."</p>

<p>The custom of sending out cards for a certain
day throughout one month avoids a "crush"
on any one day, and enables a hostess to receive
informally without giving up a great part of
her time.</p>

<p>The informal entertainment is a greater
compliment to guests than any formal entertainment,
however splendid.</p>

<p>The hostess should preserve the happy medium
between neglecting and overattending to
her guests.</p>

<p>When a hostess wishes to have her friends
meet an expected guest, she should inform them
of the intended visit beforehand, and so enable
them to make an engagement to meet her, or
plan entertainment for her. Invitations to a
reception in honor of a friend can well be, and
should be, sent out in advance of her coming,
if her stay is to be short, and if the dates of
her stay are definitely known.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><a href="images/147.png">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>At a reception for the introduction of a
friend, the hostess and the guest of honor will
stand near the door of the drawing-room and
receive. If the reception is very large, the butler
announces the names of the guests as they
enter. The hostess gives her hand to the newcomer,
and presents her to the guest of honor.
After a few words of greeting, the caller passes
on into the room where the refreshments are
served.</p>

<p>The refreshments usually consist of dainty
sandwiches, salads, perhaps creamed oysters or
chicken, bouillon, chocolate, coffee, or lemonade.</p>

<p>Afternoon teas are less formal and less elaborate
than receptions. The refreshments consist
of tea, with thin slices of bread and butter, thin
biscuits, and cake.</p>

<p>At a dancing party the hostess receives, together
with her daughters and any guests whom
she honors by asking. The host may receive, as
well, but his chief duty is to keep a watchful
eye upon his guests, looking out for the chaperons,
and seeing that the young people are supplied
with partners for the dances.</p>

<p>At a d&eacute;butante party the mother stands nearest
the drawing-room door, the daughter next
her, and the father beyond. The mother greets
each guest and then introduces the daughter.
At the supper or dinner her brother or father
takes out the d&eacute;butante, who sits at her father's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><a href="images/148.png">[148]</a></span>
left. In case her brother takes her out, her
father takes out the oldest or most honored lady
present.</p>

<p>The successful host and hostess see to it that
all their guests are introduced to each other, if
this is possible, so that the best of cordiality
and the least restraint may characterize their
mingling.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Breakfasts and Luncheons</i></div>

<p>Breakfasts may be homelike, informal affairs,
or quite ceremonious. The hour of this meal
is at any time before one o'clock, usually twelve
or twelve-thirty. After one o'clock the affair
becomes a luncheon.</p>

<p>Men are invited to a breakfast, but usually
at a luncheon the guests are all women.</p>

<p>A real breakfast menu, such as is often served
on Sunday mornings in the country, consists of
fruit, cereal, a chop, or steak, or fishballs, with
potatoes, eggs in some form, muffins or hot rolls,
and coffee, waffles or hot cakes, or, in New England,
doughnuts.</p>

<p>The menu for luncheon consists usually of
soup, fruit, lobster in cutlets or croquettes, with
mushrooms, or omelet, or fish; broiled chicken,
or lamb chops, with green peas and potatoes;
a salad, crackers and cheese; ice cream, with
coffee, tea, or chocolate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><a href="images/149.png">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>At a breakfast or luncheon, as at a dinner,
every effort should be made to be punctual.
The success of such an occasion may be ruined
by a tardy guest.</p>

<p>At a luncheon one removes wraps and veils
in the dressing-room, retaining one's hat and
gloves, the latter being removed at table, and resumed
in the drawing-room after the meal, unless
cards are the form of entertainment.</p>

<p>As the guests enter the drawing-room the
hostess shakes hands with them and introduces
them to one another before going to the dining-room.
When no men are present the hostess
leads the way to the dining-room, and the guests
find their places at the table by the name cards.
When men are present the procedure to the
dining-room follows the custom at a formal
dinner.</p>

<p>It is becoming customary to use the daylight
as much as possible at all social functions; and,
indeed, at no affair, unless it be very late in
the afternoon and very ceremonious, is the
daylight excluded and the candles and chandeliers
lighted.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Formal Dinner</i></div>

<p>The most enjoyable dinner is that with four
or six guests, which is served in a simple and
only semiformal way. This enables a hostess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><a href="images/150.png">[150]</a></span>
to bring together only congenial people, and the
group is small enough for the talk to be largely
general, and thence especially valuable, as each
brings his wittiest stories, his clearest thoughts,
and his best self to the appreciative and inspiring
circle.</p>

<p>The formal dinner is usually set for seven
o'clock, or half after, or eight. The elaborate
dinner will take from an hour to two hours,
according to the number of courses and the
efficiency of the service. There should be a
waiter for every six people, although at a small
dinner an efficient maid may serve eight covers
without much delay.</p>

<p>The invitations to a formal dinner are sent
out two weeks ahead. No more people should
be asked than can be comfortably seated and
speedily served. Twenty inches at the very
least should be allowed to each cover. Children
are never present at a ceremonious dinner.</p>

<p>In choosing guests every effort should be
made to have them congenial, with no glaring
divergence of opinions, which would by any
means make any one uncomfortable if the conversation
were to become general. In seating
the guests, only congenial people should be
placed side by side. The intellectual harmony
of a dinner is as important as the culinary harmony.</p>

<p>Ladies wear gloves at a formal dinner, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><a href="images/151.png">[151]</a></span>
remove them only at table, resuming them when
dinner is over and the guests have returned to
the drawing-room.</p>

<p>The dining-room must be quietly but well
lighted. There should be no glaring lights, but
a soft radiance which is so general as to make
everything clear. An electric light hanging
eighteen inches above the table, or a tall lamp
whose light is at about the same height, either
of them well shaded, are satisfactory additions
to the candlelight.</p>

<p>Sometimes high lights are dispensed with and
only candles used. Candles should always be
lighted three minutes before the dinner is announced.
For a dinner of not more than eight
covers four candles are sufficient light.</p>

<p>Relatives are not seated side by side, as the
effort is to have a general mingling of the company.
A clever hostess will see that her guests
at a small dinner party are all introduced to
each other before they enter the dining-room.</p>

<p>The table may be round, oval, or rectangular,
but if too narrow it cannot be made to look well.</p>

<p>The tablecloth is always spread for a dinner.
A thick pad of felt or double-faced cotton flannel
should go under the tablecloth. The damask
should be immaculate and of good quality. The
tablecloth should hang almost to the floor at the
corners.</p>

<p>At each place there is a card on which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><a href="images/152.png">[152]</a></span>
guest's name is written. These place cards
often have the monogram of the hostess in the
center and are otherwise blank, except for the
name written on.</p>

<p>The place cards at a dinner should be laid
immediately before the plates of the guests or
on the napkins, which are folded squarely, and
of sufficient size to be of real usefulness.</p>

<p>In setting the table, the spoons for soup,
dessert, and coffee are arranged at the top of
the plate; the knives and forks, the latter of
several sizes, are placed on either hand, in
order of use, and the small plate for bread,
olives, etc., is on the right.</p>

<p>In eating, the oyster fork is the first used,
and then one takes the next in order. Should
one be in doubt, the rule is to glance at the
hostess and adopt her method, whatever that
may be.</p>

<p>On elegant tables, each cover, or plate, is accompanied
by two large silver knives, a small
silver knife, and fork for fish, a small fork for
oysters on the half-shell, a large tablespoon for
soup, and three large forks. The folded napkin
is laid in the center, with a piece of bread in it.
Fish should be eaten with silver knife and fork.</p>

<p>A half-ladleful of soup is quite enough for
each person, unless at a country dinner, where
a full ladleful may be given without offense.</p>

<p>Individual salts or salt cellars are now placed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><a href="images/153.png">[153]</a></span>
at each plate, and it is not improper to take salt
with the tip of the knife in lieu of a spoon.</p>

<p>The place plates stand under the oyster or
soup plates and under any course when it is
desirable to have them. Plates must be warmed
or chilled according to the temperature of the
food which is to be served in them.</p>

<p>The indispensable courses of a dinner are
soup, fish, roast, salad, and dessert. In arranging
her menu, however, each hostess will suit
herself to her pocketbook and to what she considers
good form in the amount and kind of
food.</p>

<p>The formal dinner should be served in a very
leisurely style.</p>

<p>At the daily family dinner as well as at
formal dinners, all the ladies of the house and
among the guests should be helped before any
of the men are served, even if some distinguished
guest is among the latter.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to wait until all are served
before beginning to eat at a dinner, but wait
until the hostess has commenced to eat.</p>

<p>Butter is not served at a formal dinner, and
bread is laid in the napkin beside the plate.</p>

<p>There should be no urging of guests to eat.
It is assumed that a guest is not afraid to eat
as much as he wants.</p>

<p>When the fruit napkin is brought in, the user
takes it from the glass plate on which it is laid,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><a href="images/154.png">[154]</a></span>
and either places it at his right hand, or on his
knees. The doily beneath the finger bowl is not
meant for use, but should be laid on the table
beside the finger bowl.</p>

<p>After the dinner has been eaten, and dessert
is reached, everything is cleared off but the
tablecloth, which is now never removed. A
dessert spoon is put before each guest, and a
gold or silver spoon, a silver dessert spoon and
fork, and often a queer little combination of
fork and spoon called an ice spoon. For the
after-dinner coffee a very small spoon is used.</p>

<p>Coffee may be served in demi-tasse at the
table, or later in the drawing-room. Cream is
never served with a demi-tasse.</p>

<p>The napkin should be left lying loosely beside
the plate after a meal.</p>

<p>In case either a guest or a servant meets with
any accident one should pass it over with as
much speed as possible and turn the attention
of all immediately toward some interesting matter.
A mistake should be completely ignored
by both hosts and guests.</p>

<p>Whenever a course is offered which you do not
enjoy, never decline it, but accept it, and endeavor
to take a small portion at least of it.
You avoid then the tacit criticism of the taste
of those who like it, and put your hostess at
ease.</p>

<p>No personal preferences in foods are to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><a href="images/155.png">[155]</a></span>
consulted or mentioned when one is a guest at
dinner. If one cannot accept of the fare offered,
one should have declined the invitation.</p>

<p>Should a guest be late, the hostess need not
wait more than fifteen minutes for him, after
which time, if he appear, the host rises from the
table to greet him and cover the interruption
of his entrance, but the hostess does not leave
her place. If he does not come until after the
second course, he is served only as the others are
served, and no attempt is made to serve the previous
courses to him.</p>

<p>When dinner is ready, the maid or butler appears
in the drawing-room door, catches the eye
of the hostess, and announces quietly that dinner
is served.</p>

<p>Upon the signal, the host gives his arm to the
guest of honor, and they lead the way, the lady
being seated at the right of her host. After
them come the other couples as the hostess has
planned. Each man has found upon the dressing-room
table an envelope addressed to him,
in which is the name of the lady whom he is
expected to take out to dinner, and also in the
corner "R" or "L" to indicate on which side
of the table he and his lady are to sit.</p>

<p>After all the others have passed out, the hostess
brings up the rear with the gentleman guest
of honor, who will sit at her right.</p>

<p>Evening dress should always be worn. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><a href="images/156.png">[156]</a></span>
a lady a gown with low neck and short sleeves
or elbow sleeves; for a gentleman, a dress coat
and its accompanying trousers, vest, and tie of
regulation cut and color.</p>

<p>Arrival a few minutes before the hour is customary
in order for the guests to assemble in
the drawing-room, greet their host and each
other, and proceed together to the table.</p>

<p>When the meal is finished, the hostess catches
the eye of the guest at her husband's right,
smiles understandingly, and they immediately
rise, and, followed by the rest of the ladies,
leave the room, the men standing meanwhile.
The men linger for a half-hour or so over their
cigars and coffee, or liqueurs, before following
the ladies into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>In the United States it is more usual for the
men and women to leave the dining-room together,
and the hostess to serve the coffee in the
drawing-room, than it is for the men to linger
by themselves at the table.</p>

<p>After a dinner party one should bid good-night
to the lady one has taken out to the table,
to one's host and hostess. It is not good form
to omit the latter, for she should be assured
that you at least have enjoyed the evening, and
that her effort at hospitality has been appreciated
by you. It is not necessary to take a
formal leave of the other guests. If you choose
you may wish them a general good-night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><a href="images/157.png">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>A ceremonious dinner begins with a tiny bit
of caviare on a tiny bit of toast.</p>

<p>Then comes the fruit. It may be melons,
peaches, strawberries, or grape fruit. It must
be in perfection, and should be on ice up to the
moment of serving, and must tempt the eye as
well as the palate.</p>

<p>Next comes the course of oysters or clams on
the half-shell, which should be served on
crushed ice, on oyster plates made with hollows
for the shells, and picked up with silver forks
made for the purpose. Or they may be served
more daintily without the ice, immediately
after they have been taken from the cooler, and
without delay.</p>

<p>Then a clear soup. It may be served from
a silver tureen by the hostess, or may be brought
in soup plates to the guests by the waiter.</p>

<p>Then fish. This may be served by the host
or arranged in a dainty mince and served in
shells to the separate guests. If served by the
host, potatoes very daintily cooked may accompany
it.</p>

<p>Throughout the dinner olives, salted almonds,
radishes, and similar relishes may be passed.
These are the only articles of food on the table
when the guests take their seats.</p>

<p>After the fish there can be an entr&eacute;e or two
of some delicate dish, but the roast properly
comes next. It may be turkey, beef, mutton,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><a href="images/158.png">[158]</a></span>
or lamb. The host may carve it if he pleases,
and the waiter receive portions from him and
carry them to the guests. In many houses the
lady of the house is served first, and next the
guest of honor, who is the lady at the right of
the host. With the roast some vegetables are
served.</p>

<p>Then comes a salad, and with the salad
cheese and crackers are served.</p>

<p>The dessert follows the salad, and black
coffee concludes the repast. This last may be
served at the dining table, or later in the drawing-room
by the hostess.</p>

<p>The dessert may consist of ices, fruit, pastry,
or confections. Frequently there is a final
course after the sweets, consisting of crackers
and toasted cheese.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Visits</i></div>

<p>It is now considered quite proper for the
host or hostess to specify the length of time
covered by an invitation for a visit. The complication
of duties in our present-day life makes
the assignment of even pleasures to definite
periods necessary. This is as important as the
arrangement of trains and methods by which
the guest may arrive and leave.</p>

<p>The English manner of entertaining is a
very excellent one, as it gives the guest his freedom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><a href="images/159.png">[159]</a></span>
and makes his visit of the utmost profit to
himself and also to his host. The English host
sets the time of arrival, has his servant meet
the guest at the station with conveyance, has
him met at the house door again by a servant,
and shown to his room, where he is made at
home by being offered some light refreshments.
He is told at what hour he will be received by
his host and hostess in the drawing-room, usually
a short time before dinner. Then throughout
his stay he does not see his hostess till midday,
although she provides amusement for her
guests, which he is at liberty to enjoy or ignore
as he chooses.</p>

<p>After the noon meal he may do as he chooses
through the afternoon, appearing only at dinner,
which is the formal meal of the day, and
at the general gathering of the family and
guests in the evening. The various members
of the family are ready to show the visitors
the place, or the countryside, or play their
favorite games during the day; but there is
no effort to make the entertainment formal or
to force it upon the guest. We do not wish to
see even our most honored guests or our dearest
friends all of the time, and this arrangement
makes the meeting at dinner all the more enjoyed
and valued.</p>

<p>Before inviting guests it is necessary to see
to the comfort which is represented in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><a href="images/160.png">[160]</a></span>
guest chamber. This should be as dainty and
comfortable as any chamber in the house, and,
in addition to the usual furnishings, should have
other fittings intended to supply all the comforts
of one's home. A full line of towels, toilet
articles, and even night robe, bathrobe, and
slippers should be ready for the use of the
guest in the event that her trunk and suitcase
do not arrive at the expected time.</p>

<p>If the bed is fitted out with finery as well as
with all the linen, blankets, and comfortables
which a well-set-up bed requires, the care of
the finery, its removal at night and folding up,
should not be left to the guest. This should
be attended to before bedtime by the maid, and
the bed turned down ready for occupancy.</p>

<p>There should, of course, be vacant bureau
drawers and wardrobe. The guest, especially
if her visit be for a short time, and she has not
brought her workbox, will much appreciate a
small workbasket fitted out with needles, thread,
thimble, and scissors. A desk fitted with
stationery, pens, and postage stamps adds
much to the comfort, of a guest chamber, for,
no matter how brief the stay, facilities for
writing to the distant home are needed
promptly and constantly.</p>

<p>The guest's comfort should be provided for
before her entertainment or amusement, and
she should be made to feel perfectly at home in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><a href="images/161.png">[161]</a></span>
her room, and her possession of it be absolute
for the time of her stay.</p>

<p>It is a compliment to a guest to remember
her favorite dishes, or to arrange things to suit
her known tastes and preferences.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the hostess to give the signal
for retiring. This should be done with a fine
regard for the desires of guests, rather than according
to one's personal wishes.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Special Duties of the Country Hostess</i></div>

<p>The country hostess should make her entertaining
distinctive from that of the city. Every
one should, at times, return to the country, for
both physical and mental well-being. So when
he is there, it is of great importance that he
get country fare and country life, rather than
make a fruitless attempt to live in the country
as he does in the city.</p>

<p>The country hostess should not attempt to
entertain unless she can depend upon her servants.
Her relations with them should be such
that there is no likelihood of having a houseful
of guests and the servants thereupon suddenly
weary of the quiet of the country, or for any
other trivial reason promptly departing. The
country hostess will, however, fit herself to
meet any emergency which may arise, both on
her own and her family's account, as well as on
that of her guests.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><a href="images/162.png">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore, housekeeping and entertaining
should be simplified as much as possible, and
the most unexpected of emergencies should be
anticipated and provided for, as far as may be.
Unless the country hostess is herself competent
to cook and to tend the fires, she will never be
safe in the sending out of invitations. For the
same reason, other members of the family
should be trained in helpfulness, so that an
emergency will simply mean the adoption of
emergency tactics previously agreed upon and
practiced to the point of efficiency.</p>

<p>The country hostess should remember that
to her guests the charm and novelty of the fresh
air and outdoor life are perhaps the greatest
attractions of her home. So she should see to
it that guests are left untrammeled, to go and
wander where they may wish; and also that
the guest chambers and all other rooms are kept
filled with fresh air even in the coldest of
weather.</p>

<p>Often the change to the invigorating country
air makes the guest feel colder than the actual
temperature of the room warrants. The hostess
should remember this, and should provide that
at all times the living-rooms and guest chambers
be warmed as well as ventilated. The open fireplace
is needed in addition to steam or furnace
heat in an isolated country house.</p>

<p>"Simple things need to be excellent." The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><a href="images/163.png">[163]</a></span>
hostess should provide fresh fruit, chickens,
eggs, vegetables, cream, and milk, the products
of the country, rather than the elaborate dishes
of the city.</p>

<p>The hostess should enjoy the country and
teach her guests to enjoy it. She should know
the attractive walks and drives, the places of
real interest, and she should be able to point
out the picturesque spots, and the points of
vantage for especially fine views, and to make
others feel the charm of the country.</p>

<p>The hostess should furnish outdoor occupations,
should interest her guests in making collections
of curious plants from the woodlands,
and in getting acquainted with the trees. There
should be some popular sports provided even in
midwinter, and all the necessities for the enjoyment
of these should be furnished, as well
as a library, games, and all sorts of indoor
entertainment and pastimes for the possible
days of storm which shall block all exit from
the house.</p>

<p>The serving of meals out of doors, if the
season and weather permit, is a distinctive
feature of country hospitality, and very enjoyable
to city dwellers. Breakfast and afternoon
tea are especially easy to serve on the lawn or
piazza, but more elaborate meals may be so
served if there are servants and facilities
enough. Simple meals out of doors are preferable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><a href="images/164.png">[164]</a></span>
to more elaborate meals within. In order
to do this enjoyably or successfully, it is necessary
to have the piazza or garden somewhat secluded.
A hedge, in the absence of other protection
from the curious, easily makes this
possible.</p>

<p>The informality possible in country entertaining
is its greatest charm. Neighbors should
be encouraged to "drop in" at any hour, as
the monotony of country life may thus be
greatly relieved.</p>

<p>The hostess who, in order to meet an emergency,
is obliged to do much herself, should
either simplify her plans of entertainment, so
that she could carry them through without too
great weariness to play her part as hostess by
being with her guests, or should call upon them
to assist her, and make it a companionable visit
at any rate.</p>

<p>Rural festivities are usually festivals of labor,
in which all join first in the work and later in
the play. One should endeavor to do one's part
of the work cheerfully, and in the spirit of good
comradeship, as well as share in the fun.</p>

<p>One of the most enjoyable resources of the
country hostess is the picnic. This idea may
be varied to suit any circumstances and any
surroundings. It may take the form of an
athletic frolic for the young people, or of a
reading party in some secluded and shady glen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><a href="images/165.png">[165]</a></span>
on a hot day, if the company be intellectual, or
various other forms.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Public Functions</i></div>

<p>Men and women of prominence are often
called upon to act as special hosts and hostesses
at public or semipublic functions, such as club
dinners or luncheons, society receptions, school
or college graduations, receptions given by the
heads of business houses on anniversaries or at
openings, civil or state receptions, charitable
social affairs, and the like.</p>

<p>As a rule, the etiquette and duties of such
occasions do not vary greatly from those of the
more private affairs, but usually greater formality
is observed, and there is less responsibility
on the part of the public entertainers for the
details of the service.</p>

<p>At a club reception and luncheon, the president
and chief officers of the club, with the
guests of the day, stand in line and receive for
a half-hour or more, in the parlors of the club.
When all the guests, or the most of them, have
assembled, the procession to the dining-room is
headed by the president with the guest of greatest
distinction, who is seated at his right. The
other officers follow in order of rank, with the
other guests in order of distinction.</p>

<p>After dinner, when the last course is completed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><a href="images/166.png">[166]</a></span>
and the d&eacute;bris removed, so that the tables
present a neat appearance with their decorations
intact, the president rises and raps for
order. Then, after a few introductory remarks,
he begins the program of the day. These programs
vary greatly, but usually include after-dinner
speeches of the light and happy or only
semiserious order,&mdash;unless the purpose for
which all are gathered is of serious moment,&mdash;music
both instrumental and vocal, by excellent
performers, and the responses to the
speeches, either by the president or by others of
the officers who may be called upon for brief
and pertinent remarks. A spirit of good-will
and enthusiasm should characterize such a
gathering, whatever the object of it.</p>

<p>When one is appointed on the entertainment
committee of a club, or of a city, or other body
of people, for the holding of a congress of any
sort, it is necessary to provide in minute detail
for the entertainment of guests for a period
covering the entire time of their stay. Such
guests should be met at the depot or boat landing,
should be given every assistance toward
making them acquainted with the officers of the
congress and club, and with the city, and every
detail of provision for their comfort should be
looked out for. Personal social claims upon
their time should not be so made as to conflict
with their real interest in coming, or with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><a href="images/167.png">[167]</a></span>
advantages they may have sought in the visit,
for carrying out their personal plans.</p>

<p>When one is a guest on such an occasion, he
should remember that while his entertainment
may have been official, his obligation for it is
personal, and that he should personally thank
his hosts and, in particular, his special host and
hostess, as if he had been their only guest. No
matter how absorbing the business of the congress
or conference, no matter how strenuous his
own official duties, his obligation socially is imperative,
and must be met.</p>

<p>When one is a member of the graduating class
of a school or college, or of any small group of
people who, as a society, are entertaining, one
should show the courtesy of host or hostess to
every guest. This does not mean that one is
responsible to every guest, to see that he or she
is well entertained, but that, aside from his personal
responsibilities to his own guests, he
should be, at all the public functions, in the attitude
of host to any stranger to whom he may
show even the slightest hospitality.</p>

<p>As for his own guests, there are one or two
points of special courtesy because of the nature
of the entertainment. If he is inviting young
women, or even only one, to whom he intends
to give his whole, or a large part of his time,
he must also invite her mother or chaperon.
This rule is invariable for the high-school boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><a href="images/168.png">[168]</a></span>
graduate, for the graduate of the men's college,
and for the man graduate of a co-educational
university.</p>

<p>In addition to the usual provision for guests,
he must provide for their entertainment overnight
or during their stay, if they be from the
distance. He should, in addition, and early in
their visit, acquaint them with the peculiarities
of the local college customs. These customs are
distinctive with each college, and their etiquette
should be made clear to one who, though unused
to them, is about to share them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><a href="images/169.png">[169]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>DUTIES OF THE CHAPERON</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> need of the chaperon is recognized in
communities where there are large populations,
and people are necessarily of many classes and
unknown to one another. For this reason the
system of chaperonage of the small communities
of rural America has not been as elaborate or as
strictly adhered to as that of the cities.</p>

<p>The chaperon is the accepted guardian of
very young girls, taking oversight of them in
their social life as soon as the governess gives
up her charge. The chaperon is only a poor
substitute for the rightful care of a mother, or
takes the place of a mother when the latter cannot
be present, or performs in the person of one
the duties of several mothers.</p>

<p>Young girls should never go about the streets
of a city or large town unaccompanied by an
older person or a maid. This rule is not so
much for physical protection as for the example
of teaching her that fine conduct and discretion
which will forestall the possibility of unpleasant
experiences.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><a href="images/170.png">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>When a group of young people go to some
public place of amusement or instruction, an
older person should always accompany them.
Such an attendant, who should be one of the
fathers or mothers of the young people, if possible,
would be in so great sympathy with the
spirit of the group that his presence would impose
no restraint and spoil no fun, yet it would
be a curb on undue or undignified gaiety, and
a protection against criticism.</p>

<p>The day is not very far distant when it was
expected that if a daughter entertained a young
man in the drawing-room, her father or mother
would be present during the whole of the call.
For d&eacute;butante daughters the custom still holds
good. For a daughter who has been out in society
for one or more seasons, it seems somewhat
rigorous and unnecessary, as the presence
of the father or mother for a part of the call
serves all the purposes of cordiality, and gives,
as well, the young people a chance to talk without
constraint of interests which seem perhaps
foolish and trivial to any but young people.
The wise father and mother or chaperon know
when to trust young people, and when it is best
to throw them quite upon their honor. It is
only by having responsibility for their actions
thrust thus upon them, that they ever attain to
natural dignity and self-reliance.</p>

<p>It is sometimes permitted to a young woman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><a href="images/171.png">[171]</a></span>
to be escorted to a party or entertainment alone
by a young man, but only by one who is well-known
to the family as quite to be trusted,
and only to such parties as are presided over by
responsible patronesses. This should be exceptional
for any but the young woman who has
been left without immediate family and who
has been already in society more than one season.
The duenna who acts as her natural guardian
and chaperon, ordinarily accompanies her.</p>

<p>It may be objected that there are large numbers
of young women who are of necessity unprotected
by adequate chaperonage,&mdash;through loss
of relatives, financial limitations, or the following
of some business calling or profession,&mdash;and
that they are not, in general, treated with
less respect than the young woman carefully
guarded in her home. It yet remains true that
the independent girl must needs provide for herself
a chaperon upon certain occasions, or lose
that consideration which she would keep at all
costs. A strong character welcomes the aid of
a careful observance of conventions.</p>

<p>Even the spinster of recognized professional
standing finds herself somewhat restricted in
social pleasures. She cannot go out socially with
one man more than occasionally; she has little
pleasure in going unattended; she can entertain
but infrequently and in a small way, if at all,
and never without an older married woman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><a href="images/172.png">[172]</a></span>
to assist her. She may, however, have her regular
afternoon or evening "At Home," provided
she has with her this friend; and with that
friend present, she may entertain a gentleman
caller until ten o'clock in the evening, but
she may not offer him cigarettes, nor any beverage
but tea, coffee, chocolate, or lemonade.</p>

<p>In fashionable life in the cities, the chaperon
is an important and ever-present personage.
Wherever the young d&eacute;butante goes in society,&mdash;to
every place of amusement, when walking
or driving in the park, when shopping or calling,&mdash;and
during her calling hours at home,
the chaperon is her faithful and interested attendant.</p>

<p>The common usage of smaller towns, seashore
places, and country villages differs in
degree of attendance. The only wise rule is
to follow the custom of the place in which one
may happen to be, remembering always that
the principle at the basis of the custom is wise
and valuable, and that there should be good and
sufficient reason for failing to follow it in its
entirety. It is, however, not the letter of the
law but the spirit of it which saves. Experience
shows that not always the completely
chaperoned girl is safe and the quite-free girl
in real danger. Everything depends upon the
girl, and the spirit of the chaperonage she receives.
The relations with one's chaperon should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><a href="images/173.png">[173]</a></span>
be the most intimate and reliable and trustworthy
of one's whole life; or they may be a
mere farce and evasion. As a rule, however,
too strict observance of the dictates of society
in this connection is better than too lax.</p>

<p>The careless way in which many parents allow
their sons and daughters to go off with a
group of boys and girls of their own age, unattended
by any adult, is to be deplored.
Among the parents of several young people
there certainly is some parent, who cares
enough about his children and their associates
to become a chum, and be at once a magnet to
draw them to more mature and valuable ways
of thinking, and a safeguard against that group
folly towards which the irresponsibility of
youth tends.</p>

<p>Until a girl makes her d&eacute;but in society, she
is not seen at a party of adults except in her
own home, and not there at a formal entertainment
unless it be a birthday party, a marriage,
or a christening.</p>

<p>Even after an engagement is announced, the
chaperon is still the attendant of the young
couple in fashionable circles, when they go to
any place of public amusement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><a href="images/174.png">[174]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>THE ETIQUETTE OF THE MARRIAGE ENGAGEMENT</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a wise and courteous action on the part
of a lover to consult with the parents of the
young woman and win their consent to his proposals
before he presents them to her. This is
largely a form in America, for the reason that
in a well-ordered home the young man has not
had much opportunity to pay attention to the
daughter, unless the father and mother have
considered him eligible for their daughter's
friendship; also, the daughter, rather than
the parents, does the choosing, and few parents
would have the temerity to refuse a young man,
whom they had permitted to enter their home,
a chance to try his fate. Should they have
good cause for such refusal, they should have
used their influence and authority to counteract
any favorable impression the young man
may have made, before matters came to a crisis.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Proposal</i></div>

<p>In matters of great moment, where the emotions
are deeply stirred, the trivialities of etiquette
are at once superfluous and important.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><a href="images/175.png">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>One may be so greatly overwrought as to do
the unintentionally cruel and inconsiderate
thing, unless habitual good breeding comes to
the rescue, and steadies one by showing what is
the conventional thing to do.</p>

<p>No woman should permit a friendship to culminate
in a proposal of marriage unless she is
free to entertain such a proposal and has not
decided in her own mind upon a negative answer.
Of course, there are times when she receives,
without power to check it, an unwelcome
proposal. Her refusal then should be very decisive
but very considerate. She should express
regret at the situation, and her appreciation
of the honor which has been done her,
at the same time leaving no opportunity for
future hope. In case she is already engaged,
she should tell him so.</p>

<p>If the proposal be written, it requires an immediate
answer. Urgency of response is determined
by the importance to the sender.</p>

<p>The return of a letter unopened, even if the
woman have good reason to think that it contains
a proposal which she must refuse, is extremely
rude, and should be done under no circumstances
but flagrant breach of confidence.
If a letter is received by a woman from a man
whom she has refused and whose persistency
she has sought to end, she may place the letter
in the hands of her parents, or guardians, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><a href="images/176.png">[176]</a></span>
legal representatives, to be acted on as they
think best.</p>

<p>The manner of a proposal is the touchstone
of character. No man and woman, having
passed through this experience together, can
fail to have obtained at least a glimpse of the
depths or the shallows of each other's character.</p>

<p>In a great majority of cases in America, at
least, where access to the young woman is
gained through a thousand social channels, the
real declaration of love comes spontaneously,
and is accepted or rejected before there is opportunity
even for the formal proposal. For by a
thousand half-unconscious signs does that state
of mind reveal itself. So it happens that when
the opportunity offers to settle the matter, there
is little doubt in the mind of the lover and little
hesitation on the part of the woman. This is
true in that society where really well-bred and
noble-minded women hold sway, for no woman
of character permits the man to be long in doubt
of her withdrawal of herself, when she sees he
is attracted and yet knows that she cannot respond
to his advances.</p>

<p>The method of proposing is not a matter for
a book on etiquette. It concerns, along with all
major matters of morals, those deeper things of
life, for which there is no instruction beyond
the inculcation of high ideals.</p>

<p>When the engagement is a fact and so acknowledged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><a href="images/177.png">[177]</a></span>
in the home, it is not a wise or
courteous thing for the engaged couple to monopolize
each other. Consideration on the part
of the family would see to it that they have
some time to be alone together. Yet the lovers
should be as careful to keep their place in the
social life of the home as if there were no special
attachment. For social exclusiveness shows
an absorption in each other which, if selfishly
indulged, will bring its own penalty. That a
couple are engaged denotes expectation of a
future when they will be thrown largely upon
each other's society; and, because it is essential
for those who are to marry to become thoroughly
acquainted, they should together mingle
with other people, for so are the actual traits
of character best brought out. This does not
mean that they should avoid or neglect being
alone together at times, but they should not
obviously and selfishly absent themselves.</p>

<p>The young woman should be formally courteous
to her affianced husband, and should never
slight him because he is pledged to her, nor unduly
exalt him for the same reason. She should
now remember that the broad world of her
social interests is narrowing as they intensify,
and she should not attempt in any way to break
the bounds set for the engaged girl. She should
not go alone with other young men to places of
amusement or entertainment. She should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><a href="images/178.png">[178]</a></span>
maintain her dignity so carefully as an affianced
wife, that her betrothed shall not have
the slightest reason to be jealous of the attention
she gives to the men whom she meets in
society. On the other hand she must not cater
to the man she is to marry, to the extent of failing
to do her social duty, or of making others
feel that she has no interest in them.</p>

<p>As members of the same social set, the engaged
couple will naturally meet much in society.
They should not meet with effusion, or
sufficiently marked discrimination to make
others about them embarrassed. They should
not spend too much time with each other. Their
hostess will send them out to dinner together,&mdash;which
is in marked contrast to the custom later
when they are married, for then they will always
be separated when in society. The young
woman should be careful not to permit her
fianc&eacute; to take her away in a corner from other
guests for a long time, and he should remember
to do his social duty by other young ladies present,
even if he wishes to devote himself to
one.</p>

<p>The task of meeting each other's friends,
after the engagement is announced, is one which
should be most interesting and enjoyable, and
should have nothing of that embarrassment
which comes from the sense of critical scrutiny.
The great ordeal of winning each other is decided,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><a href="images/179.png">[179]</a></span>
and the die cast. The smaller matter of
establishing friendships on a mutual basis
should be a pleasure and not an object of dread.
Real affection and deep sincerity will make all
prominent roughnesses smooth.</p>

<p>An engaged couple are apt to be in the foreground
of any social event which they may both
grace with their presence. The common human
interest of the unengaged, and the reminiscent
interest of the married, tend to focus all eyes
upon them. For this reason they will try and
be as little conspicuous as may be.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Announcement of Engagement</i></div>

<p>The announcement of an engagement may be
made in several ways, but always first by the
family of the young woman. If a public newspaper
announcement is desired, a notice similar
to the following, signed with a name and address,
must be sent to the society editor of the
local paper or papers:</p>

<p>"Mr. and Mrs. Howard Abbott announce
the engagement of their daughter Ethel to Mr.
Hayden B. Bradley, of Cleveland. The date
of the wedding has not been fixed, but it will
probably take place soon after Easter."</p>

<p>Or it may read: "Miss Ethel Abbott announces
her engagement to Mr. Hayden B.
Bradley," etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><a href="images/180.png">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>If a less public announcement is desired, the
young couple may each write personal notes to
their friends. In these notes one or two afternoons
are mentioned when the young woman
with her mother will be "At Home." This
gives an opportunity for the relatives and
friends of the young man to meet his fianc&eacute;e.</p>

<p>The entertainment will be an informal afternoon
tea, in which she and her mother receive,
the former wearing a pretty but not too rich-looking
gown with long or elbow sleeves. Sandwiches,
cakes, and tea should be served.</p>

<p>If an engagement is to be for long, it would
be well to have the announcement of it as quiet
as possible, or not to announce it until the time
for the wedding draws near, and, also, for the
young people not to be seen very much together
until its final stages.</p>

<p>Immediately upon the announcement of an
engagement, the mother of the man should at
once call upon the young woman and her
mother, and invite them, or the entire family,
to dinner.</p>

<p>The family of the young man should be the
first to make advances. The other members of
the young man's family should call upon the
young woman promptly, even if they have never
met her before, or, if calling is impossible, they
should write and express their approval and
good wishes. According to the position of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><a href="images/181.png">[181]</a></span>
family, should the elaborateness of entertainment
be. It is a nice custom, when the young
lady lives in another city and has never met the
family of her fianc&eacute;, for them to invite her to
come and visit them.</p>

<p>The calls of his family upon her, and their
letters to her, should be very promptly returned
or answered.</p>

<p>If the young woman live in the country, her
father will invite the young man for a visit.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Bridal "Showers"</i></div>

<p>The bestowal of engagement presents has of
late years taken on a wholesale aspect. Instead
of the occasional receipt of a present from one
or another of her friends and relatives, the
bride-elect is often now the guest of honor at
one or more parties called "showers," and the
recipient of numerous gifts which are literally
showered upon her. There are many kinds of
"showers," as many as the ingenuity and financial
resources of friends may admit of. When,
however, any one bride is to be made the object
of a series of such attentions, it is well for the
girl's friends who have the matter in hand to
see to it that no one person is invited to more
than one shower, or, if so invited, that it be at
her own request and because she wishes to
make several gifts to her friend.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><a href="images/182.png">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>These affairs should be purely spontaneous
and informal, and occasions of much fun and
jollity. Nevertheless, there is danger of overdoing
the idea, and making the recipient feel
burdened rather than gratified by the zeal of
her friends in her behalf.</p>

<p>Effort should be made not to have the articles
given at a "shower" duplicate each other.
They should be some simple, useful gifts, which
will be of immediate service, and need not be
either expensive or especially durable, unless
the giver so desires. A "shower" is usually
given when a wedding is in prospect, and the
necessity of stocking up the new home confronts
the young home-makers. The aim is to
take a kindly interest in the new home and help
to fit it out, more in the way of suggestion than
in any extravagant way, which would make the
recipients feel embarrassed or indebted, or overload
them with semidesirable gifts.</p>

<p>The "shower" is usually in the afternoon,
and is joined in almost exclusively by the girl
friends of the bride-elect, with perhaps a few
of her older women friends and relatives. If,
however, it comes in the evening, the men of the
bridal party are usually also invited. The refreshments
are simple and the style of entertainment
informal. The invitations to a
"shower" are usually given by the hostess
verbally, or she sends her cards by post with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><a href="images/183.png">[183]</a></span>
words "Linen shower for Miss Hanley on
Wednesday at four."</p>

<p>There is a wide range of possible kinds of
"showers," but the only rational way is to
choose for a donation party of this sort only such
objects as will be needed in quantity and variety,
and in the choice of which one has not too strong
and distinctive taste, as, for instance, the following:
Linen, towels, glass, books, fancy
china, silver, spoons, aprons, etc. Of course,
the furnishings of some one room, as the bath-room,
laundry, or kitchen, might be the subject
of a "shower," but usually a housewife would
prefer to have what she wanted and nothing else
for use in these places.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Broken Engagement</i></div>

<p>When an engagement is broken the young
woman should return to the young man all letters
and presents, and may ask, by a brief,
courteous, but dignified, note, for the return
of her letters to him. It would not be necessary,
ordinarily, to write such a note, as the
man would take the sending back of his gifts
as final, and to mean the return of hers also.</p>

<p>In case the wedding is near, so that wedding
presents have been received from friends, the
no longer "bride-elect" should return them to
the givers with an explanatory note. The note<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><a href="images/184.png">[184]</a></span>
should mention nothing beyond the fact that the
engagement has been broken.</p>

<p>The mother of the young woman is the one
to announce the breaking of the engagement.
She quietly does so, by word of mouth or notes
to friends. In case of a broken engagement,
it is not delicate to allude to it, unless one is a
very intimate friend, and then it is better to
leave the first broaching of the subject to the
one most concerned.</p>

<p>It is customary for the privilege to be granted
the woman of terminating an engagement without
offering any explanation other than her will.
Nevertheless, she will not use this privilege
arbitrarily, without casting a shadow upon her
reputation and character for faithfulness and
integrity. A man is expected to make no explanation,
even privately, as to the reason for the
breaking of the engagement, as the release must
at least appear to come from the woman. Whatever
she chooses to say, or however unjust the
remarks of friends seem, he is in honor bound to
show great reserve, and not to cast any shadow
upon her reputation, even if his own suffers
instead.</p>

<p>However, in many circles to-day it is enough
to say that an engagement has been broken
mutually, even though no reason is obvious.
This should be so, for if too much comment
attaches to the breaking of a marriage engagement,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><a href="images/185.png">[185]</a></span>
marriages will be entered into the almost
certain outcome of which is the divorce court.</p>

<p>A lady should never accept any but trivial
gifts, such as flowers, a book, a piece of music,
or a box of confectionery, from a gentleman
who is not related to her. Even a marriage
engagement does not make the acceptance of
costly gifts wise.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Preparation for a Wedding</i></div>

<p>The preparation which the bridegroom makes
for the new home, is, of course, by far the larger
share of its establishment. He provides the
home, furnishes it with everything but the
linen, which the bride will bring, and the ornamental
decorations, including silver for the
table, which the wedding guests may, in these
days of lavish presents, be expected to furnish.</p>

<p>Even if he does not choose to set up a house-home
at once, the provision for the future is all
his, and he has to bring to the wedding the
wherewithal to make a home, whether it be in
household furniture or only the certificates
of wealth with which to provide for the bride.
This is a matter of pride with even the poorest
lover,&mdash;with all save that small class of men
who, either from the most worldly of motives
or, in the very opposite extreme, from motives
so high that they will not permit personal pride<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><a href="images/186.png">[186]</a></span>
to stand in the way of the real union of hearts,
submit to the indignity of becoming pensioners
rather than donors.</p>

<p>Whatever the custom for the division of responsibility
in regard to the home and the
future, in actual life, in every true home responsibility
is equal, and convenience alone decrees
what the bride and the bridegroom shall
each contribute to the common hoard.</p>

<p>The bridegroom also provides a part of the
wedding, and although his share is minimized,
yet it is often a costly and important part. He
should provide the flowers which the bride and
her attendants carry. The bride usually chooses
her flowers, which are ordinarily white roses,
lilies of the valley, or fragrant white flowers of
her favorite kind.</p>

<p>Besides providing the wedding ring, the
bridegroom usually presents to the bride some
gift. It is perhaps the deed of the house he
has bought and furnished for her. Or it may
be jewelry, or anything else that she desires and
that he may have it in his power to bestow.
The bride makes him no special gift other than
her hand, as that is her supreme gift.</p>

<p>The personal provision of the bridegroom
sometimes consists of a new wardrobe throughout,
besides his wedding suit. If he is wise he
will wear his new suits somewhat before he appears
in them as newly married. His wedding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><a href="images/187.png">[187]</a></span>
suit will consist of evening dress, if he is to be
married in the evening, complete with white
gloves and tie, and boutonni&egrave;re of the same
flowers as the bride's bouquet. If married in
the afternoon, or any time before six o'clock,
he will wear a frock coat of black, white vest,
gray trousers, and white tie and gloves. In case
the wedding is in the evening and the bride is
to wear her traveling dress, hat, and gloves, the
bridegroom may wear the same suit as for an
afternoon wedding, if he chooses.</p>

<p>The custom of having a new wardrobe
throughout is not necessarily followed, of course.
It is through the bridegroom's consideration for
the bride, and his appreciation of the housewifely
duties which she undertakes on his behalf,
that he makes those as small as possible
at first, knowing that the years will bring her
her full share.</p>

<p>The bride's wedding wardrobe is made a matter
of special moment, because it is for the last
time that she is outfitted by her father. Therefore,
he wishes to give her all that she needs for
some time to come, that she may grow used to
reliance upon her husband before he has to
undertake the burden of her personal expenses
in the matter of clothes.</p>

<p>The outlay, however, is limited in quantity
to the probable needs of the first season of married
life, if the bride is wise, as there is no wisdom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><a href="images/188.png">[188]</a></span>
in having more garments than can be worn
to advantage before the style changes.</p>

<p>No sensible woman will set a standard of expenditure
too high for her future income, in
what she buys for her wedding wardrobe. The
only circumstances in which she should exceed
the modest sum of her usual outlay,&mdash;beyond
the fact that she needs more and special garments
for the different social occasions, and has
a pride in having them as nice as possible,&mdash;are
those in which she marries a man of much
higher social station and much larger income
than her own. In that case it may be well for
her to put some of her savings for the future
into the gowns which she knows will be necessary
for her in her new station.</p>

<p>The special gowns necessary for a bride are:
Her wedding gown,&mdash;which is of pure white
if a maiden, or pearl gray or some other delicate
color if a widow,&mdash;the wedding veil, the
traveling suit, a reception gown, a church suit,
a somewhat elaborate visiting suit, a plain
street suit, house dresses, a dainty wrapper,
and a new outfitting of underclothing, in number
and quality to suit her usual custom, or as
nice as she can afford.</p>

<p>For the bride whose purse is not overfull the
number of gowns and suits can be materially
diminished; the wedding gown, with some slight
changes, such as the removal of the high collar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><a href="images/189.png">[189]</a></span>
and long sleeves, can be used as an evening
dress; the traveling, church, and visiting suit
may be one and the same; the house dresses
may be reduced to a minimum by frequent
washing. That one cannot provide an elaborate
wardrobe with which to begin married life
should not be a barrier to a marriage which in
every other respect appears to be auspicious.</p>

<p>The bride's trousseau proper, or that store of
linen which she provides for her new home,
should consist of approximately the following:</p>

<p>For every bed three pairs of sheets, three
pairs of pillow cases, three bolster cases, one or
two pairs of blankets, two counterpanes, and an
extra quilt.</p>

<p>For her bedrooms she should provide table,
stand, and bureau covers, as the style of the
furniture may suggest, and also such covers for
couch pillows or armchairs as a thrifty housewife
would desire for the sake of cleanliness.</p>

<p>For the bath-room there should be three dozen
towels, a half-dozen bath towels. Towels for
the maid should also be included.</p>

<p>For the dining-room, four tablecloths and two
dozen napkins for common use, with two finer
tablecloths and two dozen napkins for special
occasions, make ample provision for the average
home. There should be doilies and tray cloths,
covers for the sideboard, also mats and centerpieces
for the table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><a href="images/190.png">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>For the kitchen, three dozen cloth towels for
dishes, hand towels, cleaning cloths, holders,
and every necessary sort of towel in abundance.
With the increasing use of the paper towel,
much of this provision for bath-room and
kitchen may be dispensed with, as the paper
towel is much neater and more economical.</p>

<p>The wedding gown, which is of white satin
or silk, and usually as rich and elegant as the
bride can afford, is always cut high in the neck
and with long sleeves, or, if elbow sleeves, they
are supplemented by long gloves, which are not
removed even at the wedding breakfast. The
custom is to wear white exclusively from veil
to shoes. Whether or not the veil is worn, a hat
is never provided for this gown.</p>

<p>It is customary, in case a bride is married
in her traveling suit, for her to wear the hat
and gloves which go with it. At a home wedding,
however, this rule is not usually adhered
to, unless the couple leave at once.</p>

<p>The bridal veil and orange blossoms are worn
only at the first marriage of a woman, and usually
only with a gown made with a train.</p>

<p>The bridegroom should acquaint himself with
the rules and regulations in regard to the marriage
license some weeks ahead of the date set
for the wedding, if possible, as the rules vary
in different states, and in some a period of
residence or notification is necessary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><a href="images/191.png">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>A marriage certificate, furnishing easily
available knowledge of the legality of the marriage
and its date, is often of great convenience
in the disposition of property, the probating of
wills, and in the settlement of numerous questions
which might arise in minor matters. This
should be provided before the ceremony, filled
out and signed immediately after it by the
officiating clergyman, and signed by several witnesses.</p>

<p>The wedding ring is, by long established custom,
a plain gold band. It should be of the
best gold, and the fashion now is for it to be
moderately narrow and thin rather than wide
and thick. The ring, the unbroken circle, is
symbolic of eternity. The bridegroom gives it
into the keeping of the best man, whose duty
it is to hand it promptly to him at the proper
moment of the ceremony. The initials and date
are engraved upon the inner surface of the ring.
When wider rings were worn some appropriate
sentiment was also often engraved.</p>

<p>Once placed upon the bride's finger, it is her
pride to see that it is never removed. As Mrs.
Sangster feelings says, "It is a badge of honor,
and, worn on any woman's hand, a symbol of
her right to belong to the ranks of worthy matrons."</p>

<p>It is well to rehearse the movements of the
bridal procession within a day or two of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><a href="images/192.png">[192]</a></span>
ceremony, that there may be no flaw in the conduct
of the actors in this dramatic bit of realism.
If it is to be a church wedding, more than
one rehearsal may be required. In that case the
organist should be present, as well as every
member of the bridal party, except the clergyman.
The opening of the church for such rehearsal
is included in the fee which the sexton
receives, which ranges from ten to fifty dollars.</p>

<p>Usually refreshments, in the form of either
a dinner or supper, follow the rehearsal, the
bride entertaining at her home.</p>

<p>If the Episcopal service is to be used, or any
other service in which the bride and bridegroom
kneel, cushions for their use should be provided.
These are usually covered in white satin, with
outer covers of very sheer lawn upon which the
initials may be worked.</p>

<p>The floral decorations of the church or home
should be subordinated to the main interest;
that is, they should not be too elaborate, take
up too much room, or do other than furnish a
fitting background for the bridal couple. The
decorations usually follow some definite color
scheme, although simply the white flowers with
green foliage are appropriate and symbolic for a
church wedding. A few palms, simple bouquets
of flowers arranged naturally and gracefully,
with foliage to contrast and fill the corners,
will decorate an altar or make a pleasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><a href="images/193.png">[193]</a></span>
bower. When costliness rather than beauty is
the effect of flowers, the display is vulgar.</p>

<p>An awning should be stretched from the
house or church door to the sidewalk, so that
the guests and bridal party may not be subjected
to the gaze of curious passers-by as they
leave the carriages. An attendant should be
stationed at the sidewalk to open the doors of
the carriages, and to give to the coachmen and
guests numbers by which their carriages may
be speedily called.</p>

<p>While the provision of the carriages belongs
with all other things to the bride's family, the
carriages for the bridegroom and his family
are provided by them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><a href="images/194.png">[194]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE CONDUCT OF A WEDDING</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> cities at present the most fashionable
hour for the ceremony is "high noon," following
the English custom, and in remembrance
of the long-standing tradition which placed the
wedding early in the day, before the night's
fast had been broken.</p>

<p>The afternoon is a suitable time, as it enables
friends to gather more conveniently from the
distance, and as the reception with refreshments
is much more easily arranged for than is a
breakfast. For an afternoon wedding, three
o'clock is the proper hour in the winter, four
o'clock in the summer.</p>

<p>The evening was at one period the fashionable
time, and it still retains its popularity and
long will among the middle class of people and
in the country, because a larger gathering of
friends can be expected at that time, as all are
free from business and household cares.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Church Wedding</i></div>

<p>For the church wedding special arrangements
must be made for the seating of the guests. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><a href="images/195.png">[195]</a></span>
certain number of pews in the center front of
the church are reserved for the families and intimate
friends of the bride and bridegroom.
The reservation is indicated by a broad white
ribbon barrier across the aisle, or a garland of
flowers. The family of the bride is seated on
one side of the aisle, and that of the bridegroom
on the other.</p>

<p>The ushers should be at the church at least
a half-hour before the guests begin to arrive.
They wear small buttonhole bouquets of flowers
like those used in the decorations of the church,
which are sent them there by the florist.</p>

<p>In seating the guests they should take great
care to seat in the reserved space only those
whose names are on the list given them as belonging
there. Therefore, they ask the name
of each guest whom they do not know before
assigning him his seat. Sometimes, however,
each of these special guests is provided with a
card which he gives to the usher.</p>

<p>When a gentleman and lady enter the church
together, the usher offers his right arm to the
lady, and the gentleman follows them as they
proceed down the aisle. When several ladies
arrive together, the usher offers his arm to the
eldest, and requests the others to follow as he
conducts her to her seat.</p>

<p>Each usher asks of each guest whether he is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><a href="images/196.png">[196]</a></span>friend of the bride or bridegroom, and seats
him accordingly, upon the left of the church
if a friend of the bride, upon the right if a
friend of the groom. In case the bridegroom is
from the distance, and therefore there are few
of his friends present, this custom is not followed.</p>

<p>Immediately before the bridal party appears,
the mother of the bride is escorted by the head
usher to a seat in the front pew. Any sisters or
brothers of the bride who may not be in the
bridal procession enter with their mother.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the bridal party has been gathering,
the bridesmaids going to the home of the
bride and there receiving from her their bouquets,
which are the gift of the bridegroom.
Thence they take carriages to the church, where
they all arrive at the hour set for the ceremony.
When the first carriage arrives, containing two
of the bridesmaids,&mdash;as the carriage of the
bride and her father is the last,&mdash;the head
usher closes the inner vestibule door, and the
other ushers see that all entrance at side doors
is barred. When the bride arrives the outer
street doors are closed, and the procession forms.
Two of the ushers have already carried the
broad white ribbon down the sides of the main
aisle, thus shutting in the pews, and have taken
down the ribbon barrier across it.</p>

<p>The bridegroom and his best man have come
in a carriage by themselves and entered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><a href="images/197.png">[197]</a></span>
church by the vestry door. They and the clergyman
await the notice of the bride's arrival.</p>

<p>The organist, who has been playing appropriate
selections while the guests were assembling,
begins on the wedding march as the doors
to the church are thrown open in signal that all
is in readiness. The audience rises. The
clergyman takes his place, and the bridgegroom
and best man enter, the former standing at the
clergyman's left, the latter just behind the
bridegroom, who is facing the aisle down which
the bride will come.</p>

<p>First come the ushers, two and two, keeping
pace with the time of the music, which is a
stately, dignified march. The bridesmaids follow,
also two and two, with about six feet of
space between each couple. The maid of honor
alone, or the maid and matron of honor together,
then come. The flower girl, or flower children
follow, scattering flowers from a basket hung
upon the left arm.</p>

<p>Then come the bride and her father, or nearest
male relative, she with downcast eyes and
leaning upon his right arm.</p>

<p>The procession divides as it reaches a spot
opposite the place where the bride and bridegroom
are to stand, or, in an Episcopal church,
the top of the chancel steps; half go to the
right and half to the left. The bridesmaids
stand between the ushers, all being grouped in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><a href="images/198.png">[198]</a></span>
a semicircle. The maid of honor stands at the
left, in front of the bridesmaids and near the
bride.</p>

<p>The bridegroom advances to meet the bride,
who leaves her father and takes the bridegroom's
hand, then accepts his left arm and is
escorted by him to a position in front of the
clergyman. The couple kneel for a moment
before the ceremony begins.</p>

<p>At the place in the ceremony where the question
is asked, "Who giveth this woman to be
married to this man?" the father, who has
been standing a few feet back, advances and
places the bride's right hand in that of the
clergyman, who places it in the right hand of
the bridegroom. The father then takes his seat
in the front pew with his wife, whom, as they
leave the church, he escorts.</p>

<p>Should a widowed mother be the only one
to respond to this inquiry, she simply rises
from her seat and bows. In such a case the
bridegroom usually enters with the bride, and
the procession is less elaborate.</p>

<p>When the troth is being plighted and the ring
is about to be given, the best man hands it to
the bridegroom, who passes it to the bride. She
hands it to the clergyman, who returns it to the
bridegroom. Then the latter places it upon the
third finger of the bride's left hand. The significance
of the passing of the ring is that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><a href="images/199.png">[199]</a></span>
completes a circle, the symbol of eternity, of
which the clergyman is one, thus symbolizing
the sanction of the church.</p>

<p>After the ceremony the clergyman congratulates
the newly wedded couple, and the bride
takes the right arm of her husband, walking
thus down the aisle, the bridal party following
in reverse order, the ushers therefore last. Even
at a stately church ceremonial it has been known
for the bride to stop and kiss her mother before
passing down the aisle.</p>

<p>The duties of the maid of honor during the
service are to take from the bride her glove and
bouquet as the clergyman asks the bride and
bridegroom to join hands. Then it is her care
to remove the veil from before the face of the
bride when the ceremony is over, and to turn the
train of her gown that it may fall rightly as
she passes up the aisle.</p>

<p>Occasionally when there are two main aisles
to the church, the bridal procession enters on
the one amid the friends of the bride, and returns
on that amid the friends of the groom, to
signify that the bride has now become one of
them.</p>

<p>The best man follows the clergyman to the
vestry, hands him the fee, if the groom had not
before done so, and passes down the side aisle
to signal for the bridal carriage, and to give
the bridegroom his hat and coat. He then goes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><a href="images/200.png">[200]</a></span>
to the bride's house, where he assists the ushers
in introducing the guests to the pair.</p>

<p>The organist starts up a very joyous march
at the conclusion of the ceremony, and continues
playing while the guests are dispersing.</p>

<p>Following the bridal procession the families
and intimate friends of the couple pass out before
the audience, as the ribbon barriers which
reserve the aisle are not taken down until all
have passed out. If the reception is at the
home, this gives the bridal party time to enter
the carriages; if the reception is in the church
parlors, it gives time for them to take their
places in the receiving line.</p>

<p>At the bride's home there is now time, before
the guests arrive, for all of the bridal party to
congratulate and felicitate the bride and bridegroom,
and also to sign after them the register
of the marriage, which is in the care of the best
man. This is usually in the form of a book
bound in white, with the initials of the bride
and bridegroom embossed upon it, and opportunity
is usually given for the wedding guests
to add their signatures also.</p>

<p>The bride's mother, who is the real hostess of
the occasion, stands near the entrance of the
room in which the reception is held. In a receiving
line at the head of the room stand the
bride and bridegroom with half of the bridesmaids
ranged on the bride's right and the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><a href="images/201.png">[201]</a></span>
half on the groom's left. The parents of the
groom stand near and the father of the bride
with them or with his wife, as host. The ushers
present the guests to the bride and bridegroom,
and then to their parents, as guests of honor.
A few words of congratulation to the bridegroom
and of best wishes to the bride are all
that the few moments possible for each guest
permit. The bride offers her hand to each
guest, and presents to her husband her friends,
as he does his to her.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Home Wedding</i></div>

<p>The home wedding may be made in every
way quite as ideal as the church wedding, and
is much more simple, its privacy appealing to
many. The house will be decorated with flowers
in good taste and not too great profusion. Usually
a canopy or bower of flowers and foliage
is erected at the head of the drawing-room.
This should not be too massive, as only a special
grouping of the flowers is preferable to an
arrangement which is too crowded or shaded.</p>

<p>As the guests arrive the mother and sisters
of the bride receive them. The father of the
bride does not appear, nor, of course, does the
bride, until they enter together. A room is
placed at the disposal of the bridegroom, the
best man, and the clergyman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a><a href="images/202.png">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>At the stroke of the hour appointed, the
clergyman enters and takes his stand facing the
company. The bridegroom and best man also
enter and stand at the left of the clergyman, the
best man somewhat behind. As in a church
wedding, the broad white ribbon is used to
mark the aisle. If bouquets are attached to the
ends of it, they will hold it in place.</p>

<p>Then from the farthest corner of the room
enters the bridal procession, formed as for a
church wedding.</p>

<p>At a simple house wedding there are often
no attendants, the bride and bridegroom entering
the room together, the bride's father having
taken his position near at hand, where he can
readily respond at the right moment.</p>

<p>Another way of forming the procession,
which has all the advantages of the more elaborate
one, is for the best man to follow the
ushers, then the one bridesmaid to enter immediately
preceding the bride and bridegroom.</p>

<p>Music is often dispensed with at a home
wedding.</p>

<p>When the ceremony is over the clergyman
congratulates the couple and withdraws, and
they, turning, face their friends, who then come
to wish them happiness.</p>

<p>Whether the wedding take place in the home
or at the church, the bridal pageant has only
one object in view,&mdash;it is wholly for the sake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><a href="images/203.png">[203]</a></span>
of the bridegroom. Every woman desires to
come to her husband in all the glory of her
womanhood and of her social position. By all
custom the bridegroom does not see his bride
upon the wedding day until she approaches him
as he stands at the altar. So, with her family
doing her the utmost honor that they can, she
comes to him, bringing all that she has and is,
and placing herself and her future in his care.
The coming is just as real, however, though the
utmost simplicity prevail.</p>

<p>Back of all the minute detail of wedding
custom there is a symbolism. With the constant
elevation of the standards of marriage,
this symbolism and these customs grow purer
and more in accord with the ideals. Just as it
is always taken for granted that a marriage
ceremony is uniting loving hearts, so little by
little all that is at variance with that thought
will drop away, as have already several minor
details, and new forms and customs more in
harmony with the new ideals take the place of
the old. These changes, however, come very
gradually, and should not be hastened, but
should only keep pace with the new conceptions.
Nevertheless, there should not be too tenacious
a clinging to the old forms, which expressed
lower conceptions, when the masterly thought
of the day is forging out higher and purer
ideals of marriage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><a href="images/204.png">[204]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Wedding Breakfast</i></div>

<p>The wedding breakfast is the name given to
the refreshments which follow the noon wedding.
It is usually given when there are but
few relatives and intimate friends, because it is
an expensive feast if large numbers are invited.
It is really a dinner, served in courses, at
numerous small tables, each with a complete
dinner service. One large table, placed in the
center of the room or elsewhere conspicuously,
is reserved for the bridal party.</p>

<p>The menu usually consists of "fruit, raw
oysters, bouillon, fish or lobster in some fancy
form, an entr&eacute;e, birds and salad, ices, cakes,
bonbons, and coffee," according to one recognized
authority. Or it may be much simpler,
and include only oysters or bouillon, sandwiches
and salad, ices, cakes, and coffee.</p>

<p>Usually some punch is served in which to
pledge the bride and bridegroom. If wine is
used, champagne is customary for weddings.</p>

<p>The caterer usually supplies all the necessities
for the wedding feast, even to china, linen,
silver, candelabra, and flowers, should the
bride's parents so wish.</p>

<p>At the wedding reception, after the congratulations
and greetings are over, and the breakfast
is announced, the bride and bridegroom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><a href="images/205.png">[205]</a></span>
lead the way to the dining-room. Then comes
the bride's father with the groom's mother.
The bridegroom's father follows with some
member of the bride's family, then come the
best man and the maid of honor. The ushers
and bridesmaids pair off, and other members
of the bridal party or of the two families follow
in pairs. Lastly, as hostess of the occasion,
comes the bride's mother, with the officiating
clergyman, or the senior and highest in rank of
the clergymen, if there be more than one, as
guest of honor.</p>

<p>The rest of the guests, who are not seated at
the bridal table, find their seats as they choose,
with friends, no place cards being used.</p>

<p>For an afternoon or evening reception the
refreshments are served as for any reception.
A large table in the dining-room is decorated
with flowers and piled with the edibles, which
are served by the waiters to the guests as they
enter. The variety of food depends wholly
upon the resources of the bride's parents and
the size and elaborateness of the wedding.
Many prefer a simple repast as the hour is unusual
for a meal, and a dinner is not to be
served.</p>

<p>When the bride and bridegroom enter and
are served, the best man proposes a toast to
their health and happiness, and all present
stand, glass in hand, and pledge them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><a href="images/206.png">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>At a wedding breakfast the English custom
is to have toasts and speeches, but it is not followed
largely in this country. Where it is,
usually at a small wedding party, the father
of the bridegroom or the best man proposes the
health of the bride and bridegroom. The
father of the bride responds. Sometimes the
bridegroom is called on to respond to this toast,
which he does, proposing in turn the health of
the bridesmaids. To this the best man responds.</p>

<p>The wedding cake is a rich dark fruit cake,
which is at its best only when made months in
advance and kept in a stone crock well covered.
This is finely frosted and ornamented.</p>

<p>At the close of the wedding breakfast the
wedding cake is set before the bride, who cuts
the first slice from it. It is then passed to the
others.</p>

<p>At a large wedding, where no breakfast is
served, the wedding cake is usually cut into
small pieces and placed in white boxes, which
are decorated with the initials of the bride and
bridegroom and are tied with white ribbon.
These are placed upon a table in the hall near
the door and the guests either each take one as
he leaves, or one is handed him by a servant.</p>

<p>Sometimes a part of the wedding cake is put
away in a tin box and sealed, to be opened by
the couple on some future anniversary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><a href="images/207.png">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>The wedding cake is distinct from the bride's
cake, which may be served by the latter at a
dinner to her bridesmaids a day or more before
the wedding, and in which a thimble, a coin,
and a ring are hidden. The superstition is
that the young women who by chance receive
the slices containing these are respectively destined
for a future of single blessedness, wealth,
or domestic bliss.</p>

<p>At a reception the larger number of the
guests depart before the bridal couple go to the
dining-room. As soon as refreshments are
served them, and the toast to them has been
drunk, they retire to don suits for traveling.
The bridegroom waits for the bride at the
foot of the staircase, and the bridesmaids gather
there too, as when she comes, she throws her
bridal bouquet among them, and the bridesmaid
who catches it will be the next bride, according
to an old superstition.</p>

<p>As the outer door is opened to let the couple
out, all the friends and relatives present throw
flowers or confetti or rice after them, for good
luck, and an old white slipper is thrown after
the carriage as they drive off. The custom of
thus showering the departing couple has been
sometimes carried to such an extreme that many
refrain from it. Rice is somewhat dangerous,
and confetti is so distinctive as frequently to
cause embarrassment when in a public train or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><a href="images/208.png">[208]</a></span>
station. Flowers may appropriately be used,
and are always at hand in the decorations of
the home.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Wedding Journey</i></div>

<p>The wedding journey is the bride and bridegroom's
affair, and the knowledge of it is kept
their secret and divulged only to the best man,
who probably helps arrange for it, and to the
father and mother of the bride, and they all are
silent about it. The intrusion of even intimate
friends upon such a trip is not considered good
form.</p>

<p>The custom of taking a journey at this time
is not so rigidly observed as it used to be, many
young couples preferring to go direct to their
new home, or to a quiet country house for the
honeymoon.</p>

<p>The real wishes of the couple should be followed
out at this time, because they are now
more free from social obligations than they will
be later, and a wise start upon married life is
of all things most desirable and necessary.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Wedding Fee</i></div>

<p>The fee should be placed in an envelope or
purse, and given to the clergyman by the best
man or some friend of the bridegroom, just before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><a href="images/209.png">[209]</a></span>
or just after the ceremony, as may be most
convenient. It is sometimes handed to the
clergyman by the bridegroom at the close of the
ceremony and before the couple turn away from
the altar. It should be always given quietly,
privately, and with no display or comment.</p>

<p>The clergyman does not examine the fee or
comment upon it, other than indicating his acceptance.</p>

<p>The size of the fee is a matter of individual
taste. Because it is unostentatiously given, its
size is known only to the bridegroom and the
clergyman, and to none others unless they wish
to tell. There are some people in fashionable
circles who employ a minister only at marriages
and funerals, and who labor under the impression
that they are objects of charity and that by
them even the small favor is always thankfully
received. No one thing so denotes the degree
of real refinement in a man as the fee he offers
the clergyman for marrying him. The clergyman
is one of the three principals in the marriage
ceremony. The great majority of brides
desire that their marriage should have the sanction
and benediction of the religious body with
which they worship, or which has standing in
their community and among their people. At
the very least, in the civil marriage, without a
third party to represent either church or state
a marriage ceremony and therefore a legalized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a><a href="images/210.png">[210]</a></span>
marriage is impossible. The third principal is
therefore an important part of the affair. To
treat him shabbily in any way denotes no real
appreciation of his presence. So it is that the
true gentleman is as willing to give a handsome
fee to him, if his means permit it, as he is to
give to his bride something which shall delight
and please her, and which shall symbolize his
appreciation of the gift of herself. The bridegroom's
offering to the clergyman is indeed the
touchstone of his refinement. Wedding fees
vary from five to a thousand dollars, the usual
amount being twenty-five dollars for the fairly
affluent.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Wedding Presents</i></div>

<p>So extreme has become the custom of sending
wedding presents that it is perhaps necessary
to remind those who really desire to do the
correct thing, that a perfunctory service, or gift,
or courtesy has no intrinsic value, and the omission
of it would often be far more satisfactory
than its bestowal.</p>

<p>The usual form of wedding gift is something
of use and ornament for the new house. Silver,
linen, cut glass, or china for the dining-room,
furniture, rugs, lamps, clocks, vases, books, and
pictures, or bric-a-brac for the rest of the house,
are all appropriate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><a href="images/211.png">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>If silver is given, it should not be marked,
as the bride may have duplicates and prefer to
exchange some pieces for others, or as she may
have a special form of engraving which she prefers.
The exchange of a gift, however, removes
from it the personal thought of the giver, and
makes its acceptance more a matter of mercenary
than of friendly interest. If, however,
such exchange is made at the suggestion or with
the approval of the giver, it still remains a personal
gift. The indefinite way in which many
people choose wedding gifts for their friends,
following only the conventional ideas of what
is suitable, has taken a great deal of personal
interest from the gift at the very first.</p>

<p>The wedding gift should be a real gift in
spirit, something expressive of the giver's good
wishes, and something which the bride and
bridegroom can enjoy and appreciate for its
worth to them. Foolish things, whether expensive
or not, have no real utility or beauty,
and have always the atmosphere of insult about
them, or else always reflect upon the intelligence
of the giver.</p>

<p>A bride should acknowledge all gifts as soon
as they are received, and before her wedding
day if possible. Spontaneous rather than stereotyped
notes of thanks are preferable. They
should show appreciation of the gift, and include
the name of the bridegroom-elect in her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><a href="images/212.png">[212]</a></span>
expression of their gratitude. A bride should
remember that too elaborate notes, which are a
grave tax on her strength or time in the busy
days preceding a wedding, are unwise, as is any
other unnecessary expenditure of energy.</p>

<p>It is never obligatory to send a wedding
present. The wedding announcement and wedding
invitation are equally suggestive of such
gifts, for in either case, whether one is invited
to the ceremony or not, one is perfectly free to
do as he pleases about conferring a gift.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Country Wedding</i></div>

<p>There is an especial attractiveness and simplicity
about the out-door wedding in the country,
for those who desire to get rid of the conventional
and artificial. Such a wedding is, of
course, a day wedding. The late afternoon
might be chosen, but the twilight never. The
weather must be warm.</p>

<p>A secluded corner in the garden, the shade
of some stately tree on the lawn, or the flowery
seclusion of some orchard tree make attractive
chancels for the ceremony.</p>

<p>The grass should be cut close, and all leaves
and d&eacute;bris swept away.</p>

<p>Somewhat removed from the place of the
ceremony, but still on the lawn or piazza, small
tables and chairs may be placed in groups, and
refreshments served out of doors also.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><a href="images/213.png">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>The simplicity and homelike yet solemn atmosphere
of a wedding in a country church
appeal to many. There much of the formality
of a city church wedding may be dispensed with,
and yet the whole of the religious spirit, which
should attend a church wedding, and indeed
any wedding, be retained. The country church
lends itself more aptly to those private weddings
where the bridal party, whether small or large,
are the only spectators, than does the large city
church. The sense of exclusiveness is preserved
without the great sense of bareness and emptiness.</p>

<p>To many the private church wedding appeals
with great force. The religious and sacramental
nature of the ceremony is emphasized,
without the pomp and display of the public
service. Such a wedding usually takes place in
the daytime rather than in the evening.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><a href="images/214.png">[214]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>ETIQUETTE FOR CHILDREN</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> may be taught self-restraint and unselfish
consideration for others at so early an age
that such virtues become habitual, and minor
maxims are to a large extent unnecessary. Of
course, the child will still have to be shown the
various ways in which he can show consideration,
but he will quite frequently do of himself
those acts which make for the comfort and well-being
of others.</p>

<p>Habits of deference to elders spring from
more complex motives, and the training in them
may have to be more persistent and rigorous.
Boys should be taught to take off their caps to
their elders, both in the family and in the circle
of friends, when they meet them on the street.
They should rise when ladies enter the room,
and remain standing until all are seated.</p>

<p>An important part in a child's bringing up
is to teach him to put away his own garments
and to clear up after his play or work. If this
is instilled early into the child, there will never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><a href="images/215.png">[215]</a></span>
be any need of the pain of counteracting slovenliness,
and also never any of that disagreeable
haughtiness toward servants, which is fostered
by nothing so much as by the inch-by-inch waiting
upon a child.</p>

<p>The child who has been made a companion
of, and not repressed or driven away by the
older people of the family, has a sort of instinctive
respect for them, which, though it
may overstep itself in some daring familiarity
occasionally, is the basis of a strong authority
over him. The child who has been spied on,
and whose idea of all adults is that they are a
sort of modified policemen, will show respect
only under compulsion, and will fail in all
those fine courtesies which the thoroughly well-bred
child grows to delight in.</p>

<p>Self-control and self-repression are equal virtues
to be cultivated in the child. To permit
the child to be indifferent and inattentive when
one is trying to amuse or entertain, to be impatient
to get at the end of a story or a game,
to keep yawning; or making other expressions
of weariness when being reproved or reprimanded,
cultivates in the child a mental laziness
which is as bad as its opposite,&mdash;parrot-like
facility for chattering and asking questions,
which gives a child no chance to think, and
makes him develop into a man of only surface
intelligence and thoughtless flippancy. Even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><a href="images/216.png">[216]</a></span>
a child can appreciate, if rightly taught, the
motive back of a kind action, and can respect
that even if the action does not interest him.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is a serious matter to
allow a child to be constantly bored with lectures
on his conduct, or even with efforts to amuse
him. He should be let alone, thrown upon his
own resources, and not permitted to be taxed
beyond adult endurance by well-meaning but
futile efforts on his behalf.</p>

<p>Children should never be allowed to interrupt.
For that reason parents, and those who
have the care of children, should remember not
to monopolize the conversation when there are
children present, nor talk on and on for a long
time, as no person, least of all a child, can follow
such continuous talk without weariness.</p>

<p>Children should be taught that thinking will
answer most of their questions for them, that
they should wait and see if the answer will not
be given by something that is said later on.
Every effort made to drive the thought of a
loquacious child back upon itself is an effort in
the right direction; just as every effort made
to express and reveal the thought of an imaginative
child is much to the latter's benefit.</p>

<p>The sayings of a child should never be quoted
in his presence, nor his doings related. He
becomes hopelessly self-conscious thereby.</p>

<p>A child should be taught to respect the rights<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><a href="images/217.png">[217]</a></span>
of the father and mother to the easiest chairs in
the room, or those which they may prefer, and
should leave those chairs vacant until the father
and mother are seated elsewhere.</p>

<p>The boy who has been brought up at home,
both by precept and by his father's example,
never to seat himself at the dining table or in
the family sitting-room until his mother is
seated, will not need to be told that he should
rise in a crowded street car and give his seat
to an elderly woman. He will do it so instinctively
that it will not be a burden,&mdash;indeed,
the regret would be more keen if he could
not do it.</p>

<p>If children are present at the dining table,
it is wiser to help them first, and the grown
people last, than the reverse. In everything it
is well to follow the etiquette of adult life, as,
for instance, by helping the girls before the
boys.</p>

<p>Children should be taught to be punctual at
meals, not simply for the sake of health, but out
of consideration for the cook and for those who
might otherwise be obliged to wait for them.
They should not be allowed to hurry through a
meal because of their impatience to get at play,
although they may be wisely excused when they
are quite through. There is no value in making
them the bored, squirming, or subdued listeners
to conversation quite beyond their comprehension<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><a href="images/218.png">[218]</a></span>
or interest. They should be taught to eat
leisurely, and to regard the mealtime as a chance
to talk with their parents about interesting
things, and not simply as a time to be shortened
and slighted if possible.</p>

<p>Usually the child's first rigid lesson in punctuality
comes at the beginning of school life.
Then, most profitably, may be cultivated a sense
of the rights of others, and of his individual
responsibility toward the social group, represented
for him by his teacher and schoolmates.
If the emphasis is rightly laid upon the necessity
of his not delaying the work of his classmates
and teacher, he will naturally find many
ways in which he may apply the same thought,
greatly to his own advantage and to theirs as
well, and to the permanent strengthening of his
habits of work.</p>

<p>A keen sense of social oneness may also prevent
the too frequent heart-burnings among shy
and sensitive children. This is as easily cultivated
as is the opposite, and is of great importance
both in childhood and in later life. The
seeming injustice of the teacher may often be
made clear, and seen to be just, when the welfare
of the whole school is taken into consideration.
This is a matter of the natural enlargement
of the child's mental horizon, and if the
proper spirit has been fostered, the child will
welcome it. Should it be done carefully and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><a href="images/219.png">[219]</a></span>
wisely, the roots of many social weeds will at
once be eliminated.</p>

<p>Fault-finding should be discouraged in school
and at home. It is never the best method of
fault correction, and should not be countenanced.</p>

<p>The bringing home of tales of the teacher
and of schoolmates, in a spirit of complaint,
should not be permitted. Pleasant accounts of
happenings at school should be encouraged, but
grumbling against rules, as well as personal
gossip, should not be permitted. The authority
of the home must support the authority of the
school or the child will nowhere receive that
discipline and training which he needs in order
to meet the experiences of life.</p>

<p>The child should be allowed a certain sum of
money, which, even in the most lavish homes,
should be a little under what the wants of the
child require. The giving of this money should
be done regularly at a stated time, and there
should never be any extra giving, or increase of
the usual sum, except under very unusual circumstances,
which should not be allowed to
happen more than once a year.</p>

<p>The child should also be held accountable for
his money. If he is old enough to have any
money, or to spend any, he is old enough to tell
how he spent it, even to the last penny. Unless
all is accounted for, the habits of accuracy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><a href="images/220.png">[220]</a></span>
care are not formed. The record of this should
be written down, even if done very simply and
without special form, and later, as the child
grows older, more conventional forms of bookkeeping
should be required.</p>

<p>It should be also required that there be some
saving, which is preferably a certain proportion
of the whole, this for a beginning to which to
add extra sums as the child may wish. This
saved sum should be permanently put by, and
drawing from it should not be permitted. It
may be transferred to a bank at long intervals,
always by the child himself, and his pride in
doing it and keeping it there should be cultivated.</p>

<p>These matters may all be made a game and
sheer fun. Their grave importance is apparent
on every hand. For the child which has been
taught early to do these things, will do them
with such ease as to make it seem instinctive,
and the child who does it will never, under any
ordinary circumstances, come to want.</p>

<p>The proper behavior in church should be
taught rather by trying to inculcate the spirit of
worship than by making rules to be followed.
A child is very susceptible to impressiveness
of any sort, and if the reason for it is made
clear to him, he will be quicker to respond to it
by a reverent attitude of spirit than does an
older person. Even the obstreperous child i<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><a href="images/221.png">[221]</a></span>s
at least temporarily impressed, if he sees that
others are, and if he knows the reason for it.</p>

<p>Children should realize that it is their privilege
and duty to serve guests, whether their
own or their parents. The sacrifice of one's
own comfort for the sake of the guest takes,
with a child, the form of a sort of play, usually
because of the excitement of the arrival of a
stranger, and the possibilities of fun in the
enjoyment of the stranger's stay.</p>

<p>The child should be taught respect for the
guest's person, and should not be allowed to take
the same liberties with a gown or a glove that
sometimes the mother or aunts permit, no matter
how great the novelty of the texture or how
it appeals to the child's sense of beauty. The
privileges of being a guest should be always
duly respected, and the child be thus taught at
once his duty as a host and his position as a
guest.</p>

<p>Children should never be allowed to play
with a visitor's hat or cane, or handle furniture
or ornaments in a strange house, or show by
ill-mannerly conduct the curiosity which a
child, in unaccustomed surroundings, naturally
feels. They can be taught so great a respect
for the possessions of others that they would
become able to stifle their curiosity, or express
it only at a fitting time.</p>

<p>Children should not be sent to the drawing-room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><a href="images/222.png">[222]</a></span>
to entertain visitors, unless the visitors
request it themselves. Nor should they be allowed
to be troublesome to visitors or guests at
any time, any more than servants should be
allowed to be insolent. They should never be
allowed the freedom of the rooms of the guests,
nor to visit them often or long.</p>

<p>Children should not be permitted to enter
into the pleasures of their elders when, to do
so, would be to spoil the kind of sociability for
which the occasion was intended. At all formal
functions, children are out of place. When
making formal calls, children are usually in
the way, and the silent part they are forced to
play is disagreeable for them. They are also
out of place at a funeral, or in a cemetery, or
anywhere that there is mourning. It is an injury
to a child to see grief,&mdash;unless it be his
great concern, and in that case it is no longer a
matter of etiquette, but of necessary life experience.</p>

<p>Children should not dine out except by special
invitation. It is as discourteous to permit a
child thoughtlessly to inconvenience a neighbor,
as it is wrong for the child to think that such
uninvited visits are permissible.</p>

<p>A child should be taught never to touch what
does not belong to it, except with the express
permission of the owner. This applies to goods
in a store, as well as to the furniture of places<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><a href="images/223.png">[223]</a></span>
other than his home, and to the belongings of
others in his home.</p>

<p>A child should not be allowed to intrude into
a drive, a walk, a call, or a conversation. It
is unfair to the child, and awkward for him,
and is no kindness, as it takes away the benefit
which he might otherwise derive from the pleasure
either by continually snubbing his self-respect,
or by repressing his energy and curiosity
to the danger point.</p>

<p>Children should not be allowed to go to picnic
parties, unless they have been invited and entertainment
prepared for them.</p>

<p>Children should be taught to treat servants
with all the politeness with which they treat
their elders, and with much more consideration.
The converse of the servants with children
should be of the same careful and pleasant
quality that the best parents use and desire.
This may well be insisted upon. On the other
hand, the children should be taught that servants
are busy people, that they should never be
imposed upon, and that unnecessary work
should not be made for them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><a href="images/224.png">[224]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>ETIQUETTE OF MOURNING</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> the occasion of a death in the family
a reliable undertaker is at once notified and his
suggestions followed as to the necessary preparations
to be made for the funeral.</p>

<p>The shades are drawn throughout the front
of the house, as a sign that the family is in
retirement. The women of the family are not
seen upon the street unless necessary, the men
taking full charge of all business matters. The
directions which the undertaker desires should
be decided upon by the family, or nearest relative
of the deceased, and then some one member
of the family should be delegated to see that
they are carried out. Palm leaves tied with
ribbon or chiffon, spray bouquets of white
flowers tied with ribbon, an ivy wreath broken
with a bunch of purple everlasting, are much
preferred to crape upon the door.</p>

<p>Press notices of the funeral and death should
be sent to the newspapers. The conduct of the
funeral should be arranged with the clergyman
chosen to officiate, the superintendent of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><a href="images/225.png">[225]</a></span>
cemetery consulted (usually through the undertaker),
and the notes of request sent to those
chosen to act as pallbearers. Sometimes the
latter are purely honorary, the undertaker furnishing
the bearers. The honor is usually given
to intimate family friends, or close business
associates in case of a business man.</p>

<p>A carriage is always provided for the clergyman,
and he is entitled to a fee, although clergymen
do not charge it, either at a home or church
funeral. If the service is held at a church, the
sexton, organist and singers,&mdash;and the singers
at a home funeral as well,&mdash;are entitled to
recompense for their services.</p>

<p>Carriages are sent for the pallbearers, and
are also provided to convey the family, and as
many of the friends as may be invited to go, to
the cemetery.</p>

<p>One may announce in the newspaper "Burial
private," in which case it is understood that
only the family attend at the grave; or "No
flowers" if the family wish the usual sending
of flowers dispensed with.</p>

<p>The clergyman usually consults the wishes
of the family as to the form of service, the
hymns or music, and remarks. The funeral
service should be brief, and preferably a ritual
service with no sermon or eulogy. The last are
usually harrowing to the feelings of the
mourners, and there should be every reasonable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><a href="images/226.png">[226]</a></span>
effort made to relieve the tension of the occasion,
for the sake of the living.</p>

<p>At a church funeral the pallbearers sit in the
first pews at the left of the center aisle; the
family in those to the right. At a home funeral
it is customary to have the family in some secluded
room near the one where the coffin is
placed and to have the clergyman stand in the
hall between, or at the entrance of the drawing-room,
where he may be readily heard by all.</p>

<p>If the service at the grave immediately follows
the funeral the house should meanwhile
be aired, the shades lifted, the flowers all sent
away to some hospital, and the rooms arranged
in the usual way.</p>

<p>Before a funeral at the home, it is necessary
for some member of the family to receive the
relatives from the distance, and the very intimate
friends, and see that they are given
necessary refreshment, and their return to
trains, if they must leave immediately after the
funeral, thoroughly understood by the hackmen.</p>

<p>At a home funeral the singers should be somewhat
distant from the family, so that the music
is not loud.</p>

<p>The members of the family are dressed in
hats and veils ready to enter the carriages, before
the service. They pass to view the body,&mdash;if,
according to a former custom, the casket is
left open,&mdash;last of all, and enter the last <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><a href="images/227.png">[227]</a></span>carriage
before that of the pallbearers, which immediately
precedes the hearse.</p>

<p>In sending flowers to a funeral, one's card is
enclosed. There should be no slightest sense of
obligation in the sending of flowers, and each
piece should represent only real sympathy or
respect.</p>

<p>The putting on of black garments as a sign
that one has lost a near relative has been much
modified by the good sense of the people, and
the period of mourning shortened, especially in
England. In stating the accepted mourning
custom, the moderate observance of it has been
given, both extremes being ignored.</p>

<p>Crape is the quality of goods most closely
allied with mourning. Black dresses trimmed
with black crape are usually worn for the first
few months by women who have lost a near
relative. The black veil worn by widows is now
of moderate length, and usually not of the very
thick material which was once in vogue. A
ruche of white is now placed just inside the
bonnet, which relieves the black effect somewhat.
Black furs and sealskins are worn with mourning.</p>

<p>The English fashion of six months of the
deepest mourning and six months of secondary
is meeting with more and more approval in this
country, although for a close relative a year is
the first period and six months the second.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><a href="images/228.png">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>One who is in mourning does not appear in
society for the first six months; after that it
is permissible to attend a concert or musical,
but not the theater or a reception while severe
mourning is worn.</p>

<p>During the mourning period, black-bordered
stationery is used. The border on paper and
envelopes is usually three-eighths of an inch
for a close relative and half that for a more
distant one, or during the secondary period of
mourning, if one cares to make the change.
The personal visiting card has a black border
during this time.</p>

<p>The handkerchief is bordered with narrow
black, or is of narrow-bordered, plain, sheer
linen.</p>

<p>For relatives-in-law it is not customary to
put on black, although for a father- or mother-in-law
it is customary, in the best society, to
dress nearly as for an own father or mother.</p>

<p>A widower wears a complete suit of black,
white linen, dull-black silk neckties, dull-black
leather shoes, black gloves, and a black ribbon
of broader width upon his hat.</p>

<p>The mourning band sewed upon the coat
sleeve is a discredited form of mourning. It
does not denote the nearness of the loss, and
has only the virtue of cheapness for those who
cannot afford to show marked respect to the
dead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><a href="images/229.png">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Men do not observe the custom of withdrawing
from society for as long a time as do the
women, but usually reappear at the homes of
intimate friends, at public places of entertainment,
and at the club after two or three months.
As long as the mourning band is worn upon the
hat, however, no man should attend large and
fashionable functions, as dinner or dancing
parties, or the theater.</p>

<p>After six months a woman may resume calling,
returning the calls of those who called upon
her in the early weeks of her bereavement.</p>

<p>Children of fifteen years of age and under
should not wear mourning.</p>

<p>The viewing of the body of the deceased as
it lies in the casket is the privilege of only the
family and the immediate friends, and should
not be requested by others. Therefore, the
casket is now usually closed before the funeral
service, especially if that be at a church. In
case of a man in public office, it is sometimes
necessary that the body should lie in state for
certain hours, when the public may pay their
respects.</p>

<p>Punctuality is very necessary in regard to
everything connected with a funeral service, as
the overwrought nerves of those who are sorrowing
should not be taxed to bear any extra
tension.</p>

<p>Within ten days after the funeral, a card of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><a href="images/230.png">[230]</a></span>
thanks for sympathy should be sent to all who
have called upon the family or sent flowers or
offered their services in any way.</p>

<p>When one is in mourning, one does not attend
a wedding reception, though one may be
present at the ceremony. Black should not be
worn.</p>

<p>Mourners announce their return to society by
sending out their cards to friends and acquaintances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><a href="images/231.png">[231]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>MILITARY, NAVAL, AND FLAG ETIQUETTE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> social usage in respect to military or
naval officers follows ordinarily the customs of
formal occasions or occasions of state in civilian
life, or is provided for in the instructions of
the army and the navy, which the members of
those two departments of the service would alone
be expected to know. There are, however, one or
two occasions where the etiquette of social life
is, or may be, modified by the formalities due to
these representatives of the Government.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Formal Military Wedding</i></div>

<p>The church or formal home wedding where
the bridegroom and his attendants are all army
men, may have the distinctive feature of the
arch of swords or bayonets. The bridegroom and
the ushers, in that case, are all in full dress uniform.
The bride and bridesmaids are dressed
daintily and fluffily to afford contrast. The
church should be decorated with palms and lilies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><a href="images/232.png">[232]</a></span>
and with the national and the regimental flags in
the chancel. As the organist begins the wedding-march,
two color-bearers of the regiment, carrying
one the national flag and the other the regimental
colors, precede the bridegroom and the
best man from the vestry. The latter take
their usual places, and the color-bearers move
to a position at either side of the chancel steps.
After the ceremony, they move to the head of
the aisle, and the ushers form a line to the
foot of the chancel steps. The ushers then put
on their caps, unsheathe their swords, or raise
their bayonets, and form an arch with them.
Under this arch pass the bride and bridegroom,
and the bridesmaids. Then, sheathing their
swords and removing their caps, the ushers fall
into line at the end of the procession.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Naval and Yachting Usage</i></div>

<p>When one is the guest of the owners or
the officers of a yacht, or of the officers of
a government warship or other large vessel,
it is well to know that in the lading of the
gig for reaching and leaving the ship, the order
of precedence is always as follows: Juniors
in rank or official importance enter the
gig first, and the one highest in rank immediately
precedes the Captain, who is always the
last to embark and the first to disembark. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><a href="images/233.png">[233]</a></span>
leaving the gig, the order is reversed from that
on entering it, the junior in rank thus being the
last to leave the boat.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>The Etiquette of the Flag</i></div>

<p>The flag is displayed every day only on government
buildings and schoolhouses. On state
holidays, and like commemorative days when it
is customary for the flag to be displayed on private
buildings, it should be raised at sunrise and
lowered at sunset. It should not be displayed
on stormy days, nor left out over night. It
should never be allowed to touch the ground.
When it is to be displayed at half-mast only, it
should be raised to the tip of the staff and
then lowered halfway. It should never be festooned
or draped, but always be hung flat.</p>

<p>On Memorial Day, May 30, the flag should be
displayed at half-mast until twelve o'clock noon,
and then raised to the top of the staff until
sunset. The salute for the changing of the position
of the flag at all army posts and stations
having artillery, is as follows: immediately
before noon, the band plays some appropriate
air, and at the stroke of twelve the national
salute of twenty-one guns is fired. After this
the flag is hoisted to the peak of the staff,
while everybody stands at attention, with hand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a><a href="images/234.png">[234]</a></span>
raised to the forehead ready for the salute.
When the colors reach the top, the salute is
given, and the band plays patriotic airs.</p>

<p>The salute to the flag is used at its formal
raising, and when it passes on parade or in review.
The hand salute according to the regulations
of the United States Army is as follows:</p>

<p>"Standing at attention, raise the right hand to
the forehead over the right eye, palm downward,
fingers extended and close together, arm at an
angle of forty-five degrees. Move hand outward
about a foot, with a quick motion then drop to
the side. When the colors are passing on parade
or in review, the spectator should, if walking,
halt, if sitting, arise, and stand at attention
and uncover."</p>

<p>In schools two forms of salute are taught.
The first, for primary children, is: "We give
our heads and our hearts to God and our country;
one country, one land, one flag." The second,
for all other pupils, is: "I pledge allegiance
to my flag and to the Republic for which it
stands: one nation indivisible, with liberty and
justice for all."</p>

<p>When the flag is carried on parade, it is
dipped in salute to the official who is reviewing
the parade. Whenever the flag is displayed with
other flags,&mdash;whether the colors of a regiment or
other military organization, or of alien nations,&mdash;it
should be placed, or carried, or crossed, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a><a href="images/235.png">[235]</a></span>
the right of the other flag or flags. When portrayed
in illustrations by any process or for
any purpose, it is so pictured that the staff
will always be at the left and the fabric will
float to the right.</p>

<p>The chief regulations governing the composition
of the flag are as follows: In the <i>field</i>
of the flag there should be thirteen horizontal
stripes, alternating red and white, the first and
the last stripes red. These stripes represent the
thirteen original colonies. The colors red and
white were chosen by George Washington, the
red from the flag of England, the Mother
Country, broken by the white, symbolizing liberty,
to show the separation. The <i>union</i> of the
flag&mdash;white stars on a field of blue&mdash;should be
seven stripes high, and about seven-tenths of the
height of the flag in length. "The stars should
have five points, with one point directly upward."<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
The stars symbolize the States. "By
an act of Congress on October 26, 1912, the flag
now has forty-eight stars, arranged in six horizontal
rows of eight each."</p>
